	 abstract={The mechanism by which left-right {(LR)} information is interpreted by organ primordia during asymmetric morphogenesis is largely unknown. We show that spleen and pancreatic laterality is dependent on a specialised, columnar mesodermal-derived cell layer referred to here as the splanchnic mesodermal plate {(SMP).} At early embryonic stages, the {SMP} is bilateral, surrounding the midline-located stomach and dorsal pancreatic bud. Under control of the {LR} asymmetry pathway, the left {SMP} is maintained and grows laterally. Mice carrying the dominant hemimelia {(Dh)} mutation lack the {SMP.} Significantly, the mice are asplenic and the pancreas remains positioned along the embryonic midline. In the absence of Fgf10 expression, the spleno-pancreatic mesenchyme and surrounding {SMP} grow laterally but contain no endodermal component, showing that leftward growth is autonomous and independent of endoderm. In the Bapx1(-/-) mutants, the {SMP} is defective. Normally, the {SMP} is a source for both Fgf9 and Fgf10; however, in the Bapx1 mutant, Fgf10 expression is downregulated and the dorsal pancreas remains at the midline. We conclude that the {SMP} is an organiser responsible for the leftward growth of the spleno-pancreatic region and that Bapx1 regulates {SMP} functions required for pancreatic laterality.}

  abstract={The performance of a next-generation optical computed tomography scanner {(OCTOPUS-5X)} is characterized in the context of three-dimensional gel dosimetry. Large-volume (2.2 L), muscle-equivalent, radiation-sensitive polymer gel dosimeters {(BANG-3)} were used. Improvements in scanner design leading to shorter acquisition times are discussed. The spatial resolution, detectable absorbance range, and reproducibility are assessed. An efficient method for calibrating gel dosimeters using the depth-dose relationship is applied, with photon- and electron-based deliveries yielding equivalent results. A procedure involving a preirradiation scan was used to reduce the edge artifacts in reconstructed images, thereby increasing the useful cross-sectional area of the dosimeter by nearly a factor of 2. Dose distributions derived from optical density measurements using the calibration coefficient show good agreement with the treatment planning system simulations and radiographic film measurements. The feasibility of use for motion (four-dimensional) dosimetry is demonstrated on an example comparing dose distributions from static and dynamic delivery of a single-field photon plan. The capability to visualize three-dimensional dose distributions is also illustrated.},

  abstract={Obtaining high-resolution information from a complex system, while maintaining the global perspective needed to understand system function, represents a key challenge in biology. Here we address this challenge with a method (termed {CLARITY)} for the transformation of intact tissue into a nanoporous hydrogel-hybridized form (crosslinked to a three-dimensional network of hydrophilic polymers) that is fully assembled but optically transparent and macromolecule-permeable. Using mouse brains, we show intact-tissue imaging of long-range projections, local circuit wiring, cellular relationships, subcellular structures, protein complexes, nucleic acids and neurotransmitters. {CLARITY} also enables intact-tissue in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry with multiple rounds of staining and de-staining in non-sectioned tissue, and antibody labelling throughout the intact adult mouse brain. Finally, we show that {CLARITY} enables fine structural analysis of clinical samples, including non-sectioned human tissue from a neuropsychiatric-disease setting, establishing a path for the transmutation of human tissue into a stable, intact and accessible form suitable for probing structural and molecular underpinnings of physiological function and disease.},

These tools are easily integrated for use with current commercial {OPT} scanners and should also be possible to implement in {"}home made{"} or experimental setups for {OPT} imaging.

To solve these problems this paper proposes a fast and automatic center of rotation search method making use of parallel programming in graphics processing units {(GPUs).} Our method is based on a two step search approach making use only of those sections of the image with high signal to noise ratio. We have tested this method both in non-scattering ex vivo samples and in in vivo specimens with a considerable contribution of scattering such as Drosophila melanogaster pupae, recovering in all cases the center of rotation with a precision 1/4 pixel or less.},

Optical Projection Tomography {(OPT)} is a new technology which has been developed for rapidly generating digital {3D} models of intact specimens.

Here we developed a tetrahydrofuran-based clearing procedure that renders fixed and unsectioned adult {CNS} tissue transparent and fully penetrable for optical imaging. In large spinal cord segments, we imaged fluorescently labeled cells by 'ultramicroscopy' and two-photon microscopy without the need for histological sectioning. We found that more than a year after injury growth-competent axons regenerated abundantly through the injury site. A few growth-incompetent axons could also regenerate when they bypassed the lesion. Moreover, we accurately determined quantitative changes of glial cells after spinal cord injury. Thus, clearing {CNS} tissue enables an unambiguous evaluation of axon regeneration and glial reactions. Our clearing procedure also renders other organs transparent, which makes this approach useful for a large number of preclinical paradigms.},

  abstract={Comprehensive verification of the intricate dose distributions associated with advanced radiation treatments is now an immediate and substantial problem. The task is challenging using traditional dosimeters because of restrictions to point measurements (ion chambers, diodes, {TLD,} etc.) or planar measurements (film). In essence, rapid advances in the technology to deliver radiation treatments have not been paralleled by corresponding advances in the ability to verify these treatments. A potential solution has emerged in the form of water equivalent three dimensional {(3D)} gel-dosimetry. In this paper we present basic characterization and performance studies of a prototype {optical-CT} scanning system developed in our laboratory. An analysis of the potential role or scope of gel dosimetry, in relation to other dosimeters, and to verification across the spectrum of therapeutic techniques is also given. The characterization studies enabled the determination of nominal operating conditions for {optical-CT} scanning. {{"}Finger{"}} phantoms are introduced as a powerful and flexible tool for the investigation of {optical-CT} performance. The modulation-transfer function {(MTF)} of the system is determined to be better than 10\% out to 1 mm(-1), confirming sub-mm imaging ability. System performance is demonstrated by the acquisition of a 1 x 1 x 1 mm3 dataset through the dose distribution delivered by an x-ray lens that focuses x rays in the energy range 40-80 {KeV.} This {3D} measurement would be extremely difficult to achieve with other dosimetry techniques and highlights some of the strengths of gel dosimetry. Finally, an optical Monte Carlo model is introduced and shown to have potential to model light transport through gel-dosimetry systems, and to provide a tool for the study and optimization of {optical-CT} gel dosimetry. The model utilizes Mie scattering theory and requires knowledge of the variation of the particle size distribution with dose. The latter was determined here using the technique of dynamic-light-scattering.}

  abstract={In single-photon emission computed tomography {(SPECT),} projection data are acquired by rotating the photon detector around a patient, either in a circular orbit or in a noncircular orbit. The projection data of the desired spatial distribution of emission activity is blurred by the point-response function of the collimator that is used to define the range of directions of gamma-ray photons reaching the detector. The point-response function of the collimator is not spatially stationary, but depends on the distance from the collimator to the point. Conventional methods for deblurring collimator projection data are based on approximating the actual distance-dependent point-response function by a spatially invariant blurring function, so that deconvolution methods can be applied independently to the data at each angle of view. A method is described here for distance-dependent preprocessing of {SPECT} projection data prior to image reconstruction. Based on the special distance-dependent characteristics of the Fourier coefficients of the sinogram, a spatially variant inverse filter can be developed to process the projection data in all views simultaneously. The algorithm is first derived from Fourier analysis of the projection data from the circular orbit geometry. For circular orbit projection data, experimental results from both simulated data and real phantom data indicate the potential of this method. It is shown that the spatial filtering method can be extended to the projection data from the noncircular orbit geometry. Experiments on simulated projection data from an elliptical orbit demonstrate correction of the spatially variant blurring and distortion in the reconstructed image caused by the noncircular orbit geometry.},

  abstract={Fluorescence microscopic imaging is widely used in biomedical research to study molecular and cellular processes in cell culture or tissue samples. This is motivated by the high inherent sensitivity of fluorescence techniques, the spatial resolution that compares favorably with cellular dimensions, the stability of the fluorescent labels used and the sophisticated labeling strategies that have been developed for selectively labeling target molecules. More recently, two and three-dimensional optical imaging methods have also been applied to monitor biological processes in intact biological organisms such as animals or even humans. These whole body optical imaging approaches have to cope with the fact that biological tissue is a highly scattering and absorbing medium. As a consequence, light propagation in tissue is well described by a diffusion approximation and accurate reconstruction of spatial information is demanding. While in vivo optical imaging is a highly sensitive method, the signal is strongly surface weighted, i.e., the signal detected from the same light source will become weaker the deeper it is embedded in tissue, and strongly depends on the optical properties of the surrounding tissue. Derivation of quantitative information, therefore, requires tomographic techniques such as fluorescence molecular tomography {(FMT),} which maps the three-dimensional distribution of a fluorescent probe or protein concentration. The combination of {FMT} with a structural imaging method such as X-ray computed tomography {(CT)} or Magnetic Resonance Imaging {(MRI)} will allow mapping molecular information on a high definition anatomical reference and enable the use of prior information on tissue's optical properties to enhance both resolution and sensitivity. Today many of the fluorescent assays originally developed for studies in cellular systems have been successfully translated for experimental studies in animals. The opportunity of monitoring molecular processes non-invasively in the intact organism is highly attractive from a diagnostic point of view but even more so for the drug developer, who can use the techniques for proof-of-mechanism and proof-of-efficacy studies. This review shall elucidate the current status and potential of fluorescence tomography including recent advances in multimodality imaging approaches for preclinical and clinical drug development.},

Various methods for enhancing penetration of optical-clearing agents into tissue, such as physical methods, chemical-penetration enhancers and combination of physical and chemical methods are introduced. Combining the tissue optical clearing technique with advanced microscopy image or labeling technique, applications for {3D} microstructure of whole tissues such as brain and central nervous system with unprecedented resolution are demonstrated. Moreover, the difference in diffusion and/or clearing ability of selected agents in healthy versus pathological tissues can provide a highly sensitive indicator of the tissue health/pathology condition. Finally, recent advances in optical clearing of soft or hard tissue for in vivo imaging and phototherapy are introduced. {[Formula:} see text].},

  abstract={A technique for measuring the presampled {MTF} in {CT} scanners is described. The technique uses a simple phantom consisting of approximately 0.050 mm aluminum foil sandwiched by flat plastic or tissue-equivalent slabs. The aluminum foil is slightly angled with respect to the reconstruction matrix, and {CT} images are acquired. The acquired {CT} image yields an angled slit image that can be used to synthesize the presampled line spread function {(LSF).} The presampled {MTF} is calculated from the presampled {LSF.} The technique is a direct extension of that proposed by Fujita et al. {[IEEE} Trans. Med. Imaging 11, 34-39 (1992)] for {MTF} calculation on digital radiography images. While the {MTF} in clinical {CT} scanners often reaches negligible amplitude below the Nyquist frequency, the technique is easy to implement, requires inexpensive materials, is robust to aliasing, and is more resilient to noise due to greater data averaging than conventional {PSF-integration} techniques. Use of the proposed technique is illustrated on a clinical multiple detector array scanner, and {MTFs} are shown for several common reconstruction kernels. It is likely that the proposed technique would be useful for all tomographic imaging systems, including single photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound scanners.},

  abstract={A method is presented for imaging single isolated cell nuclei in {3D,} employing computed tomographic image reconstruction. The system uses a scanning objective lens to create an extended depth-of-field {(DOF)} image similar to a projection or shadowgram. A microfabricated inverted v-groove allows a microcapillary tube to be rotated with sub-micron precision, and refractive index matching within 0.02 both inside and outside the tube keeps optical distortion low. Cells or bare cell nuclei are injected into the tube and imaged in 250 angular increments from 0 to 180 degrees to collect 250 extended {DOF} images. After these images are further aligned, the filtered backprojection algorithm is applied to compute the {3D} image. To estimate the cutoff spatial frequency in the projection image, a spatial frequency ratio function is calculated by comparing the extended depth-of-field image of a typical cell nucleus to the fixed focus image. To assess loss of resolution from fixed focus image to extended {DOF} image to {3D} reconstructed image, the 10-90\% rise distance is measured for a dyed microsphere. The resolution is found to be 0.9 microm for both extended {DOF} images and {3D} reconstructed images. Surface and translucent volume renderings and cross-sectional slices of the {3D} images are shown of a stained nucleus from fibroblast and cancer cell cultures with added color histogram mapping to highlight {3D} chromatin structure.},

  abstract={A new method of dosimetry of ionizing radiations has been developed that makes use of tissue-equivalent polymer gels which are capable of recording three-dimensional dose distributions. The dosimetric data stored within the gels are measured using optical tomographic densitometry. The dose-response mechanism relies on the production of light scattering microparticles which result from the polymerization of acrylic comonomers dispersed in the gel. The attenuation of a collimated light beam caused by scattering in the irradiated optically turbid medium is directly related to the radiation dose over the range 0-10 Gy. An optical scanner has been developed which incorporates an {He-Ne} laser, photodiode detectors, and a rotating gel platform. Using mirrors mounted on a translating stage, the laser beam scans across the gel between each incremental rotation of the platform. Using the set of optical density projections obtained, a cross sectional image of the radiation field is then reconstructed. Doses in the range 0-10 Gy can be measured to better than 5\% accuracy with a spatial resolution approximately 2 mm using the current prototype scanner. This method can be used for the determination of three-dimensional dose distributions in irradiated gels, including measurements of the complex distributions produced by multi-leaf collimators, dynamic wedge and stereotactic treatments, and for quality assurance procedures.}

The noisy line spread functions {(LSFs)} acquired from an angulated slit image are fitted using a combination of two functions by means of a nonlinear least-square fitting technique. The parameters in the model function for each {LSF} are obtained by minimizing the residual root mean square {(RMS),} and then averaged over all the {LSF} fittings. The resulting analytical function is representative of the continuous presampled {LSF.} We have found that a combination of Gaussian and exponential functions provides a good fit to the {LSFs} obtained with film digitizers. The corresponding analytical Fourier transformation of the model function yields the presampling {MTF,} without Nyquist frequency limitation.

  abstract={Optical projection tomography {(OPT)} is an imaging modality that has, in the last decade, answered numerous biological questions owing to its ability to view gene expression in 3 dimensions {(3D)} at high resolution for samples up to several cm(3). This has increased demand for a cabinet {OPT} system, especially for mouse embryo phenotyping, for which {OPT} was primarily designed for. The Medical Research Council {(MRC)} Technology group {(UK)} released a commercial {OPT} system, constructed by Skyscan, called the Bioptonics {OPT} 3001 scanner that was installed in a limited number of locations. The Bioptonics system has been discontinued and currently there is no commercial {OPT} system available. Therefore, a few research institutions have built their own {OPT} system, choosing parts and a design specific to their biological applications. Some of these custom built {OPT} systems are preferred over the commercial Bioptonics system, as they provide improved performance based on stable translation and rotation stages and up to date {CCD} cameras coupled with objective lenses of high numerical aperture, increasing the resolution of the images. Here, we present a detailed description of a custom built {OPT} system that is robust and easy to build and install. Included is a hardware parts list, instructions for assembly, a description of the acquisition software and a free download site, and methods for calibration. The described {OPT} system can acquire a full {3D} data set in 10 minutes at 6.7 micron isotropic resolution. The presented guide will hopefully increase adoption of {OPT} throughout the research community, for the {OPT} system described can be implemented by personnel with minimal expertise in optics or engineering who have access to a machine shop.},

Imaging performance tests confirm high geometrical accuracy, accurate relative measurement of linear attenuation coefficients, and the ability to image features at the 50-microm level. Optical labeling of organ microvasculature was achieved using two stains deposited via natural in vivo circulatory processes: a passive absorbing ink-based stain and an active fluorescin {FITC-lectin} conjugate. The lectin protein binds to the endothelial lining, and {FITC} fluorescense enables {optical-ECT} imaging. Three-dimensional {(3-D)} {optical-CT} images have been acquired of a normal rat heart and left lung and a mouse right lung showing exquisite detail of the functional vasculature and relative perfusion distribution. Coregistered {optical-ECT} images were also acquired of the mouse lung and kidney. Histological sections confirmed effective labeling of microvasculature throughout the organs.

  abstract={Previous research on optical computed tomography {(CT)} microscopy in the context of the synchrotron microbeam has shown the potential of the technique and demonstrated high quality images, but has left two questions unanswered: (i) are the images suitably quantitative for {3D} dosimetry? and (ii) what is the impact on the spatial resolution of the system of the limited depth-of-field of the microscope optics? Cuvette and imaging studies are reported here that address these issues. Two sets of cuvettes containing the radiochromic plastic {PRESAGE\&\#xAE;\&\#xA0;were} irradiated at the {ID17} biomedical beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation facility over the ranges 0-20 and 0-35 Gy and a third set of cuvettes was irradiated over the range 0-20 Gy using a standard medical linac. In parallel, three cylindrical {PRESAGE\&\#xAE;\&\#xA0;samples} of diameter {9.7\&\#xA0;mm} were irradiated with test patterns that allowed the quantitative capabilities of the optical {CT} microscope to be verified, and independent measurements of the imaging modulation transfer function {(MTF)} to be made via two different methods. Both spectrophotometric analysis and imaging gave a linear dose response, with gradients ranging from {0.036-0.041\&\#xA0;cm(-1)\&\#xA0;Gy(-1)\&\#xA0;in} the three sets of cuvettes and 0.037 (optical {CT} units) {Gy(-1)\&\#xA0;for} the imaging. High-quality, quantitative imaging results were obtained throughout the {3D} volume, as illustrated by depth-dose profiles. These profiles are shown to be monoexponential, and the linear attention coefficient of {PRESAGE\&\#xAE;\&\#xA0;for} the synchrotron-generated x-ray beam is measured to be (0.185 {\&\#xB1;} {0.02)\&\#xA0;cm(-1)\&\#xA0;in} excellent agreement with expectations. Low-level (\&lt;5\%) residual image artefacts are discussed in detail. It was possible to resolve easily slit patterns of width {37\&\#xA0;\&\#xB5;m} (which are smaller than many of the microbeams used on {ID-17),} but some uncertainty remains as to whether the low values of {MTF} for the higher spatial frequencies are scanner related or a result of genuine (but non-ideal) dose distributions. We conclude that microscopy images from our scanner do indeed have intensities that are proportional to spectrophotometric optical density and can thus be used as the basis for accurate dosimetry. However, further investigations are necessary before the microscopy images can be used to make the quantitative measures of peak-to-valley ratios for small-diameter microbeams. We suggest various strategies for moving forward and are optimistic about the future potential of this system.},

  abstract={Methods based on magnetic resonance imaging for the measurement of three-dimensional distributions of radiation dose are highly developed. However, relatively little work has been done on optical computed tomography {(OCT).} This paper describes a new {OCT} scanner based on a broad beam light source and a two-dimensional charge-coupled device {(CCD)} detector. A number of key design features are discussed including the light source; the scanning tank, turntable and stepper motor control; the diffuser screen onto which images are projected and the detector. It is shown that the non-uniform pixel sensitivity of the low-cost {CCD} detector used and the granularity of the diffuser screen lead to a serious ring artefact in the reconstructed images. Methods are described for eliminating this. The problems arising from reflection and refraction at the walls of the gel container are explained. Optical ray-tracing simulations are presented for cylindrical containers with a variety of radii and verified experimentally. Small changes in the model parameters lead to large variations in the signal intensity observed in the projection data. The effect of imperfect containers on data quality is discussed and a method based on a 'correction scan' is shown to be successful in correcting many of the related image artefacts. The results of two tomography experiments are presented. In the first experiment, a radiochromic Fricke gel sample was exposed four times in different positions to a 100 {kVp} x-ray beam perpendicular to the plane of imaging. Images of absorbed dose with slice thickness of 140 microm were acquired. with 'true' in-plane resolution of 560 x 560 microm2 at the edge of the 72 mm field of view and correspondingly higher resolution at the centre. The nominal doses measured correlated well with the known exposure times. The second experiment demonstrated the well known phenomenon of diffusion in the dosemeter gels and yielded a value of (0.12 +/- 0.02) mm2 s(-1) for the diffusion coefficient of the xylenol orange/iron complex. Finally, the overall implications of the above findings for dosimetry using {OCT} are discussed.},

  abstract={A new radiotherapy technique, named microbeam radiation therapy {(MRT),} is under development at the {ID17} Biomedical Beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility {(ESRF).} This innovative method is based on the fact that normal tissue can withstand high radiation doses in small volumes without any significant damage. The promising results obtained in the preclinical studies have paved the way to forthcoming clinical trials, which are currently in preparation. Highly accurate dose calculations at the treatment planning stage are required in this context. The aims of this study are the development and experimental benchmarking of a photon beam source model, which will be the core of the future {MRT} treatment planning system {(TPS).}},

  abstract={We demonstrate two techniques to improve the quality of reconstructed optical projection tomography {(OPT)} images using the modulation transfer function {(MTF)} as a function of defocus experimentally determined from tilted knife-edge measurements. The first employs a {2-D} binary filter based on the {MTF} frequency cut-off as an additional filter during back-projection reconstruction that restricts the high frequency information to the region around the focal plane and progressively decreases the spatial frequency bandwidth with defocus. This helps to suppress {"}streak{"} artifacts in {OPT} data acquired at reduced angular sampling, thereby facilitating faster {OPT} acquisitions. This method is shown to reduce the average background by approximately 72\% for an {NA} of 0.09 and by approximately 38\% for an {NA} of 0.07 compared to standard filtered back-projection. As a biological illustration, a {Fli:GFP} transgenic zebrafish embryo (3 days post-fertilisation) was imaged to demonstrate the improved imaging speed (a quarter of the acquisition time). The second method uses the {MTF} to produce an appropriate deconvolution filter that can be used to correct for the spatial frequency modulation applied by the imaging system.},

  abstract={Classic histology still represents the gold standard in tumor tissue analytics. However, two-dimensional analysis of single tissue slides does not provide a representative overview of the inhomogeneous tumor physiology, and a detailed analysis of complex three-dimensional structures is not feasible with this technique. To overcome this problem, we applied multispectral fluorescence ultramicroscopy {(UM)} to the field of tumor analysis. Optical sectioning of cleared tumor specimen provides the possibility to three-dimensionally acquire relevant tumor parameters on a cellular resolution. To analyze the virtual {UM} tumor data sets, we created a novel set of algorithms enabling the fully automatic segmentation and quantification of multiple tumor parameters. This new postmortem imaging technique was applied to determine the therapeutic treatment effect of bevacizumab on the vessel architecture of orthotopic {KPL-4} breast cancer xenografts at different time points. A significant reduction of the vessel volume, number of vessel segments, and branching points in the tumor periphery was already detectable 1 day after initiation of treatment. These parameters remained virtually unchanged in the center of the tumor. Furthermore, bevacizumab-induced vessel normalization and reduction in vascular permeability diminished the penetration behavior of {trastuzumab-Alexa} 750 into tumor tissue. Our results demonstrated that this newimaging method enables the three-dimensional visualization and fully automatic quantification of multiple tumor parameters and drug penetration on a cellular level. {Therefore,UM} is a valuable tool for cancer research and drug development. It bridges the gap between common macroscopic and microscopic imaging modalities and opens up new three-dimensional {(3D)} insights in tumor biology.}

  abstract={X-ray microbeam radiation therapy {(MRT)} is a novel form of treatment, currently in its preclinical stage, which uses microplanar x-ray beams from a synchrotron radiation source. It is important to perform accurate dosimetry on these microbeams, but, to date, there has been no accurate enough method available for making {3D} dose measurements with isotropic, high spatial resolution to verify the results of Monte Carlo dose simulations. Here, we investigate the potential of optical computed tomography for satisfying these requirements. The construction of a simple optical {CT} microscopy (optical projection tomography) system from standard commercially available hardware is described. The measurement of optical densities in projection data is shown to be highly linear (r2=0.999). The depth-of-field {(DOF)} of the imaging system is calculated based on the previous literature and measured experimentally using a commercial {DOF} target. It is shown that high quality images can be acquired despite the evident lack of telecentricity and despite {DOF} of the system being much lower than the sample diameter. Possible reasons for this are discussed. Results are presented for a complex irradiation of a 22 mm diameter cylinder of the radiochromic polymer {PRESAGE,} demonstrating the exquisite 'dose-painting' abilities available in the {MRT} hutch of beamline {ID-17} at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Dose distributions in this initial experiment are equally well resolved on both an optical {CT} scan and a corresponding transmission image of radiochromic film, down to a line width of 83 microm (6 lp mm(-1)) with an {MTF} value of 0.40. A group of 33 microm wide lines was poorly resolved on both the optical {CT} and film images, and this is attributed to an incorrect exposure time calculation, leading to under-delivery of dose. Image artefacts in the optical {CT} scan are discussed. {PRESAGE} irradiated using the microbeam facility is proposed as a suitable material for producing phantom samples for quantitative characterization of optical {CT} microscopy systems.},

  abstract={Accurate determination of the spatial distribution of the absorbed dose of ionising radiation plays an important role in radiotherapy, industrial radiation processing and many other applications. Computer calculations have frequently been used to estimate three-dimensional {(3D)} dose distributions in complex geometries and it becomes important to validate these by accurate {3D} measurements. For this purpose we have been investigating the use of gelatin gels loaded with a modified Fricke solution which are pale orange in appearance and which, upon irradiation, become increasingly purple when viewed in normal light. This ferrous sulphate xylenol orange in gelatin gel {(FXG)} system displays very good properties, such as sensitivity, linearity and dynamic range, that make it suitable for {3D} dosimetry applications. A high-speed optical tomography readout technique has been developed enabling two-dimensional projections of optical absorption data to be recorded rapidly. From these data the {3D} absorbed dose distribution can quickly be derived with minimal degradation due to ion diffusion.},

  abstract={{3D} measurement of optical attenuation is of interest in a variety of fields of biomedical importance, including spectrophotometry, optical projection tomography {(OPT)} and analysis of {3D} radiation dosimeters. Accurate, precise and economical {3D} measurements of optical density {(OD)} are a crucial step in enabling {3D} radiation dosimeters to enter wider use in clinics. Polymer gels and Fricke gels, as well as dosimeters not based around gels, have been characterized for {3D} dosimetry over the last two decades. A separate problem is the verification of the best readout method. A number of different imaging modalities (magnetic resonance imaging {(MRI),} optical {CT,} x-ray {CT} and ultrasound) have been suggested for the readout of information from {3D} dosimeters. To date only {MRI} and laser-based optical {CT} have been characterized in detail. This paper describes some initial steps we have taken in establishing charge coupled device {(CCD)-based} optical {CT} as a viable alternative to {MRI} for readout of {3D} radiation dosimeters. The main advantage of {CCD-based} optical {CT} over traditional laser-based optical {CT} is a speed increase of at least an order of magnitude, while the simplicity of its architecture would lend itself to cheaper implementation than both {MRI} and laser-based optical {CT} if the camera itself were inexpensive enough. Specifically, we study the following aspects of optical metrology, using high quality test targets: (i) calibration and quality of absorbance measurements and the camera requirements for {3D} dosimetry; (ii) the modulation transfer function {(MTF)} of individual projections; (iii) signal-to-noise ratio {(SNR)} in the projection and reconstruction domains; (iv) distortion in the projection domain, depth-of-field {(DOF)} and telecentricity. The principal results for our current apparatus are as follows: (i) {SNR} of optical absorbance in projections is better than 120:1 for uniform phantoms in absorbance range 0.3 to 1.6 (and better than 200:1 for absorbances 1.0 to 3.5 with the test target and a novel absorbance range extension method), (ii) the spatial resolution is shown to be at worst 0.5 mm (and often better than this) with an associated {DOF} of 8 cm, (iii) the {SNR} of uniform phantoms in reconstruction domain is above 80:1 (one standard deviation) over an absorbance dynamic range of 0.3 to 1.6, (iv) the apparatus is telecentric and without distortion. Finally, a sample scan and reconstruction of a scan of a {PRESAGE} dosimeter are shown, demonstrating the capabilities of the apparatus.},

This is demonstrated with fluorescent samples such as Drosophila melanogaster and Medaka embryos and pollen grains imaged by Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy {(SPIM).} The application of the algorithm to {SPIM} data yields high-resolution images of organ structure and gene expression, in some cases at a sub-cellular level, throughout specimens ranging from several microns up to a millimeter in size.}

A {MOSFET} detector has been used for this study since its radio sensitive element, which is extraordinarily narrow (approximately 1 microm), suits the main applications of interest, microbeam radiation biology and microbeam radiation therapy {(MRT).} In {MRT,} micrometer-wide, centimeter-high, and vertically oriented swaths of tissue are irradiated by arrays of rectangular x-ray microbeams produced by a multislit collimator {(MSC).} We used {MOSFETs} to measure the dose distribution, produced by arrays of x-ray microbeams shaped by two different {MSCs,} in a tissue-equivalent phantom. Doses were measured near the center of the arrays and maximum/minimum (peak/valley) dose ratios {(PVDRs)} were calculated to determine how variations in heights and in widths of the microbeams influenced this for the therapy, potentially important parameter. Monte Carlo {(MC)} simulations of the absorbed dose distribution in the phantom were also performed. The results show that when the heights of the irradiated swaths were below those applicable to clinical therapy (\&lt; 1 mm) the {MC} simulations produce estimates of {PVDRs} that are up to a factor of 3 higher than the measured values. For arrays of higher microbeams (i.e., 25 microm x 1 cm instead of 25 x 500 microm2), this difference between measured and simulated {PVDRs} becomes less than 50\%. Closer agreement was observed between the measured and simulated {PVDRs} for the Tecomet {MSC} (current collimator design) than for the Archer {MSC.} Sources of discrepancies between measured and simulated doses are discussed, of which the energy dependent response of the {MOSFET} was shown to be among the most important.},

The dependence of the peak dose, in a water phantom, on the microbeam field size used in the preclinical trials, has been demonstrated.

The reduced scattering coefficients of uniform mixtures were predicted with Mie theory and measured by a commercially available spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. The results show that all of the {OCAs} used enhance the optical clearing effect of Intralipid. If {OCAs} do not change the structure of Intralipid, Mie theory prediction matches well with the measurements. And the higher the refractive index of {OCA,} the smaller the reduced scattering coefficient. A simple formula deduced can quantitatively predict the optical clearing effect caused by {OCAs.} This work is helpful for clarifying the mechanism of tissue optical clearing, which will make the effect of optical clearing of tissue predictable and controllable.},

  abstract={A Bayesian method is described for reconstruction of high-resolution {3D} images from the {microPET} small-animal scanner. Resolution recovery is achieved by explicitly modelling the depth dependent geometric sensitivity for each voxel in combination with an accurate detector response model that includes factors due to photon pair non-collinearity and inter-crystal scatter and penetration. To reduce storage and computational costs we use a factored matrix in which the detector response is modelled using a sinogram blurring kernel. Maximum a posteriori {(MAP)} images are reconstructed using this model in combination with a Poisson likelihood function and a Gibbs prior on the image. Reconstructions obtained from point source data using the accurate system model demonstrate a potential for near-isotropic {FWHM} resolution of approximately 1.2 mm at the center of the field of view compared with approximately 2 mm when using an analytic {3D} reprojection {(3DRP)} method with a ramp filter. These results also show the ability of the accurate system model to compensate for resolution loss due to crystal penetration producing nearly constant radial {FWHM} resolution of 1 mm out to a 4 mm radius. Studies with a point source in a uniform cylinder indicate that as the resolution of the image is reduced to control noise propagation the resolution obtained using the accurate system model is superior to that obtained using {3DRP} at matched background noise levels. Additional studies using pie phantoms with hot and cold cylinders of diameter 1-2.5 mm and {18FDG} animal studies appear to confirm this observation.},

  abstract={Optical emission computed tomography {(optical-ECT)} is a technique for imaging the three-dimensional {(3D)} distribution of fluorescent probes in biological tissue specimens with high contrast and spatial resolution. In {optical-ECT,} functional information can be imaged by (i) systemic application of functional labels (e.g. fluorophore labelled proteins) and/or (ii) endogenous expression of fluorescent reporter proteins (e.g. red fluorescent protein {(RFP),} green fluorescent protein {(GFP))} in vivo. An essential prerequisite for {optical-ECT} is optical clearing, a procedure where tissue specimens are made transparent to light by sequential perfusion with fixing, dehydrating and clearing agents. In this study, we investigate clearing protocols involving a selection of common fixing (4\% buffered paraformaldehyde {(PFA),} methanol and ethanol), dehydrating (methanol and ethanol) and clearing agents (methyl salicylate and benzyl-alcohol-benzyl-benzoate {(BABB))} in order to determine a 'fluorescence friendly' clearing procedure. Cell culture experiments were employed to optimize the sequence of chemical treatments that best preserve fluorescence. Texas red {(TxRed),} fluorescein isothiocyanate {(FITC),} {RFP} and {GFP} were tested as fluorophores and fluorescent reporter proteins of interest. Fluorescent and control cells were imaged on a microscope using a {DSred2} and {FITC} filter set. The most promising clearing protocols of cell culture experiments were applied to whole xenograft tumour specimens, to test their effectiveness in large unsectioned samples. Fluorescence of {TxRed/FITC} fluorophores was not found to be significantly affected by any of the test clearing protocols. {RFP} and {GFP} fluorescence, however, was found to be significantly greater when cell fixation was in ethanol. Fixation in either {PFA} or methanol resulted in diminished fluorescence. After ethanol fixation, the {RFP} and {GFP} fluorescence proved remarkably robust to subsequent exposure to either methyl salicylate or {BABB.} The optimized optical clearing procedure of ethanol fixation followed by methyl salicylate clearing preserved the fluorescence of constitutive {RFP} in whole xenograft tumour specimens, about 1 cc in dimension, indicating successful extension from cell plating experiments to whole tissue samples. Finally, the feasibility of imaging the {3D} distribution of viable tumour cells (as indicated by the {RFP} emission) is demonstrated by {optical-ECT} imaging of cleared xenograft tumours using an in-house system.},

  abstract={Optical computed tomography {(optical-CT)} and optical-emission computed tomography {(optical-ECT)} are new techniques for imaging the {3D} structure and function (including gene expression) of whole unsectioned tissue samples. This work presents a method of improving the quantitative accuracy of {optical-ECT} by correcting for the 'self'-attenuation of photons emitted within the sample. The correction is analogous to a method commonly applied in single-photon-emission computed tomography reconstruction. The performance of the correction method was investigated by application to a transparent cylindrical gelatin phantom, containing a known distribution of attenuation (a central ink-doped gelatine core) and a known distribution of fluorescing fibres. Attenuation corrected and uncorrected {optical-ECT} images were reconstructed on the phantom to enable an evaluation of the effectiveness of the correction. Significant attenuation artefacts were observed in the uncorrected images where the central fibre appeared approximately 24\% less intense due to greater attenuation from the surrounding ink-doped gelatin. This artefact was almost completely removed in the attenuation-corrected image, where the central fibre was within approximately 4\% of the others. The successful phantom test enabled application of attenuation correction to {optical-ECT} images of an unsectioned human breast xenograft tumour grown subcutaneously on the hind leg of a nude mouse. This tumour cell line had been genetically labelled (pre-implantation) with fluorescent reporter genes such that all viable tumour cells expressed constitutive red fluorescent protein and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 transcription-produced green fluorescent protein. In addition to the fluorescent reporter labelling of gene expression, the tumour microvasculature was labelled by a light-absorbing vasculature contrast agent delivered in vivo by tail-vein injection. {Optical-CT} transmission images yielded high-resolution {3D} images of the absorbing contrast agent, and revealed highly inhomogeneous vasculature perfusion within the tumour. {Optical-ECT} emission images yielded high-resolution {3D} images of the fluorescent protein distribution in the tumour. Attenuation-uncorrected {optical-ECT} images showed clear loss of signal in regions of high attenuation, including regions of high perfusion, where attenuation is increased by increased vascular ink stain. Application of attenuation correction showed significant changes in an apparent expression of fluorescent proteins, confirming the importance of the attenuation correction. In conclusion, this work presents the first development and application of an attenuation correction for {optical-ECT} imaging. The results suggest that successful attenuation correction for {optical-ECT} is feasible and is essential for quantitatively accurate {optical-ECT} imaging.},

  abstract={In both photoacoustic {(PA)} and ultrasonic {(US)} imaging, overall image quality is influenced by the optical and acoustical properties of the medium. Consequently, with the increased use of combined {PA} and {US} {(PAUS)} imaging in preclinical and clinical applications, the ability to provide phantoms that are capable of mimicking desired properties of soft tissues is critical. To this end, gelatin-based phantoms were constructed with various additives to provide realistic acoustic and optical properties. Forty-micron, spherical silica particles were used to induce acoustic scattering, {Intralipid(\&\#xAE;)} 20\% {IV} fat emulsion was employed to enhance optical scattering and ultrasonic attenuation, while India Ink, Direct Red 81, and Evans blue dyes were utilized to achieve optical absorption typical of soft tissues. The following parameters were then measured in each phantom formulation: speed of sound, acoustic attenuation (from 6 to 22 {MHz),} acoustic backscatter coefficient (from 6 to 22 {MHz),} optical absorption (from 400 nm to 1300 nm), and optical scattering (from 400 nm to 1300 nm). Results from these measurements were then compared to similar measurements, which are offered by the literature, for various soft tissue types. Based on these comparisons, it was shown that a reasonably accurate tissue-mimicking phantom could be constructed using a gelatin base with the aforementioned additives. Thus, it is possible to construct a phantom that mimics specific tissue acoustical and/or optical properties for the purpose of {PAUS} imaging studies.},

  abstract={The optical properties of India ink, an absorber often used in preparation of tissue simulating phantoms, have been investigated at visible and near infrared wavelengths. The extinction coefficient has been obtained from measurements of collimated transmittance and from spectrophotometric measurements, the absorption coefficient from multidistance measurements of fluence rate in a diffusive infinite medium with small concentrations of added ink. Measurements have been carried out on samples of India ink from five different brands, and for some brands also from different batches. As also reported in previously published papers the results we have obtained showed large inter-brand and inter-batch variations for both the absorption and the extinction coefficient. On the contrary, our results showed small variations for the ratio between the absorption and the extinction coefficient. The albedo is therefore similar for all samples: The values averaged over all samples investigated were 0.161, 0.115, and 0.115 at {\&\#x3BB;} = 632.8, 751, and 833 nm respectively, with maximum deviations of 0.044, 0.019, and 0.035. These results indicate that, using the values we have obtained for the albedo, it should be possible to obtain with uncertainty smaller than about 4\% the absorption coefficient of a sample of unknown ink from simple measurements of extinction coefficient. A similar accuracy is not easily obtained with the complicated procedures necessary for measurements of absorption coefficient.}

  abstract={For many clinical {SPECT} studies, it is important to know not only the total activity in an organ of interest, but also the details regarding the activity distribution. In our approach, the anatomical information significantly contributes to improve reconstructed images through {CT-based} attenuation, scatter, and voxelized partial volume effect corrections. Our method uses the low dose {CT} image of each particular organ or object (e.g., tumor) to create an object-specific numeric template. Assuming that the sequential projection and reconstruction of this template result in a similar deterioration as in the real image, the template information is being used to correct this image on a voxel-by-voxel basis. In our phantom experiments using clinical camera and protocols, we recovered total activities with errors less than approximately 6\% for 33ml tumor models and approximately 9\% for 120ml heart insert.},

  abstract={The quality of images reconstructed by statistical iterative methods depends on an accurate model of the relationship between image space and projection space through the system matrix The elements of the system matrix for the clinical {Hi-Rez} scanner were derived by processing the data measured for a point source at different positions in a portion of the field of view. These measured data included axial compression and azimuthal interleaving of adjacent projections. Measured data were corrected for crystal and geometrical efficiency. Then, a whole system matrix was derived by processing the responses in projection space. Such responses included both geometrical and detection physics components of the system matrix. The response was parameterized to correct for point source location and to smooth for projection noise. The model also accounts for axial compression (span) used on the scanner. The forward projector for iterative reconstruction was constructed using the estimated response parameters. This paper extends our previous work to fully three-dimensional. Experimental data were used to compare images reconstructed by the standard iterative reconstruction software and the one modeling the response function. The results showed that the modeling of the response function improves both spatial resolution and noise properties.}

  abstract={Accurate quantitation of positron emission tomography {(PET)} tracer uptake levels in tumors is important for staging and monitoring response to treatment. Quantitative accuracy in {PET} is particularly poor for small tumors because of system partial volume errors and smoothing operations. This work proposes a reconstruction algorithm to reduce the quantitative errors due to limited system resolution and due to necessary image noise reduction. We propose a method for finding and using the detection system response in the projection matrix of a statistical reconstruction algorithm. In addition, we use aligned anatomical information, available in {PET/CT} scanners, to govern the penalty term applied during each image update. These improvements are combined with Fourier rebinning in a clinically feasible algorithm for reconstructing fully three-dimensional {PET} data. Results from simulation and measured studies show improved quantitation of tumor values in terms of bias and variance across multiple tumor sizes and activity levels with the proposed method. At common clinical image noise levels for the detection task, the proposed method reduces the error in maximum tumor values by 11\% compared to filtered back-projection and 5\% compared to conventional iterative methods.},

  abstract={Conventional two-dimensional cell monolayers do not provide the geometrical, biochemical and mechanical cues found in real tissues. Cells in real tissues interact through chemical and mechanical stimuli with adjacent cells and via the extracellular matrix. Such a highly interconnected communication network extends along all three dimensions. This architecture is lost in two-dimensional cultures. Therefore, at least in many cases, two-dimensional cell monolayers do not represent a suitable in vitro tool to characterize accurately the biology of real tissues. Many studies performed over the last few years have demonstrated that the differences between three-dimensional and two-dimensional cultured cells are striking at the morphological and molecular levels and that three-dimensional cell cultures can be employed in order to shrink the gap between real tissues and in vitro cell models. End-point and long-term imaging of cellular and sub-cellular processes with fluorescence microscopy provides direct insight into the physiological behavior of three-dimensional cell cultures and their response to chemical or mechanical stimulation. Fluorescence imaging of three-dimensional cell cultures sets new challenges and imposes specific requirements concerning the choice of a suitable microscopy technique. Deep penetration into the specimen, high imaging speed and ultra-low intensity of the excitation light are key requirements. Light-sheet-based fluorescence microscopy {(LSFM)} offers a favorable combination of these requirements and is therefore currently established as the technique of choice for the study of three-dimensional cell cultures. This review illustrates the benefits of cellular spheroids in the life sciences and suggests that {LSFM} is essential for investigations of cellular and sub-cellular dynamic processes in three-dimensions over time and space.},

The optical projection tomography microscope is an optical microscope that can generate {3-D} images of single cells with isometric high resolution both in absorption and fluorescence mode. Although the depth of field of the microscope objective is in the submicron range, it can be extended by scanning the objective's focal plane. The extended depth of field image is similar to a projection in a conventional x-ray computed tomography. Cells suspended in optical gel flow through a custom-designed microcapillary. Multiple pseudoprojection images are taken by rotating the microcapillary. After these pseudoprojection images are further aligned, computed tomography methods are applied to create {3-D} reconstruction. {3-D} reconstructed images of single cells are shown in both absorption and fluorescence mode. Fluorescence spatial resolution is measured at 0.35 microm in both axial and lateral dimensions. Since fluorescence and absorption images are taken in two different rotations, mechanical error may cause misalignment of {3-D} images. This mechanical error is estimated to be within the resolution of the system.},

  abstract={A new imaging technique called emission optical projection tomography {(eOPT),} essentially an optical version of single-photon emission computed tomography {(SPECT),} provides molecular specificity, resolution on the order of microns to tens of microns, and large specimen coverage ( approximately 1 cubic centimetre). It is ideally suited to gene expression studies in embryos. Reconstructed {eOPT} images suffer from blurring that worsens as the distance from the axis of rotation increases. This blur is caused in part by the defocusing of the lens' point-spread function, which increases with object distance from the focal plane. In this paper, we describe a frequency space filter based on the frequency-distance relationship of sinograms to deconvolve the distance-dependent point-spread function and exclude highly defocused data from the {eOPT} sinograms prior to reconstruction. The method is shown to reduce the volume at half-maximum of the reconstructed point-spread function to approximately 20\% the original, and the volume at 10\% maximum to approximately 6\% the original. As an illustration, the visibility of fine details in the vasculature of a 9.5 day old mouse embryo is dramatically improved.},

  abstract={Optical projection tomography {(OPT)} imaging is a powerful tool for three-dimensional imaging of gene and protein distribution patterns in biomedical specimens. We have previously demonstrated the possibility, by this technique, to extract information of the spatial and quantitative distribution of the islets of Langerhans in the intact mouse pancreas. In order to further increase the sensitivity of {OPT} imaging for this type of assessment, we have developed a protocol implementing a computational statistical approach: contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization {(CLAHE).} We demonstrate that this protocol significantly increases the sensitivity of {OPT} imaging for islet detection, helps preserve islet morphology and diminish subjectivity in thresholding for tomographic reconstruction. When applied to studies of the pancreas from healthy {C57BL/6} mice, our data reveal that, at least in this strain, the pancreas harbors substantially more islets than has previously been reported. Further, we provide evidence that the gastric, duodenal and splenic lobes of the pancreas display dramatic differences in total and relative islet and {\&\#x3B2;-cell} mass distribution. This includes a 75\% higher islet density in the gastric lobe as compared to the splenic lobe and a higher relative volume of insulin producing cells in the duodenal lobe as compared to the other lobes. Altogether, our data show that {CLAHE} substantially improves {OPT} based assessments of the islets of Langerhans and that lobular origin must be taken into careful consideration in quantitative and spatial assessments of the pancreas.},

  abstract={The physical basis and preliminary applications of optical computed tomography {(optical-CT)} and optical emission computed tomography {(optical-ECT)} are introduced, as new techniques with potential to provide unique {3D} information on a variety of aspects of tumor structure and function. A particular focus here is imaging tumor micro-vasculature, and the spatial distribution of viable tumor cells, although the techniques have the potential for much wider application. The principle attractiveness of {optical-CT} and {optical-ECT} are that high resolution (\&lt;20 microm) and high contrast co-registered {3D} images of structure and function can be acquired for relatively large intact samples. The unique combination of high contrast and resolution offers advantages over {micro-CT} and {micro-MRI,} and the lack of requirement for sectioning offers advantages over confocal microscopy, conventional microscopy, and histological sectioning techniques. {Optical-CT/ECT} are implemented using in-house custom apparatus and a commercial dissecting microscope capable of both transmission and fluorescence imaging. Basic studies to characterize imaging performance are presented. Negligible geometrical distortion and accurate reconstruction of relative attenuation coefficients was observed. {Optical-CT} and {optical-ECT} are investigated here by application to high resolution imaging of {HCT116} xenograft tumors, about 1 cc in dimension, which were transfected with constitutive red fluorescent protein {(RFP).} Tumor microvasculature was stained in vivo by tail vein injection of either passive absorbing dyes or active fluorescent markers {(FITC} conjugated lectin). Prior to imaging, the tumors were removed (ex vivo) and optically cleared in a key process to make the samples amenable to light transmission. The cleared tumors were imaged in three modes (i) {optical-CT} to image the {3D} distribution of microvasculature as indicated by absorbing dye, (ii) {optical-ECT} using the {FITC} excitation and emission filter set, to determine microvasculature as indicated by lectin-endothelial binding, and (iii) {optical-ECT} using the {DSRed2} filter set to determine the {3D} distribution of viable tumor as indicated by {RFP} emission. A clear correlation was observed between the independent vasculature imaging modes (i) and (ii) and postimaging histological sections, providing substantial validation of the {optical-CT} and {optical-ECT} techniques. Strong correlation was also observed between the {RFP} imaging of mode iii, and modes i and ii, supporting the intuitive conclusion that well-perfused regions contain significant viable tumor. In summary, {optical-CT} and {optical-ECT,} when combined with new optical clearing techniques, represent powerful new imaging modalities with potential for providing unique information on the structure and function of tumors.},

  abstract={Optical projection tomography {(OPT)} is a new technique for three-dimensional {(3D)} imaging of small biological tissues. It is particularly useful for reconstructing vertebrate embryos and for examining the {3D} anatomy of developing organs. The advantages of this technique over previous methods will be explained: in particular, its ability to image at a higher resolution than magnetic resonance imaging {(MRI),} while at the same time being able to image specimens much larger than those possible using confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Being an optical technique, {OPT} is also able to take advantage of the many coloured and fluorescent dyes which have been developed for tissue-specific or gene-specific staining. This becomes particularly important for the visualization of the {3D} shapes of specific organs and tissues as it allows the computer to automatically determine the outline of the desired structure.},

Despite the recent burst in the number of methods focusing on {3D} reconstruction of embryonic specimens, an adequate and accessible {3D} reconstruction protocol for the visualization of patterns of gene expression is lacking. In this communication we describe a protocol that was developed for the {3D} visualization of patterns of gene expression determined by in situ hybridization {(ISH)} on serial sections. The method still requires tissue sectioning, due to penetration limits of the specific staining agents into whole embryo preparations. With regard to expenditure of resources, i.e., hardware, software, and time, the protocol is relatively undemanding. Because the variation between specimens requires the visualization of multiple specimens per stage, it was decided to {"}do more, less well.{"} The current protocol, therefore, results in reconstructions of sufficient, but not the highest, quality. The use of the protocol is demonstrated on a series of serially sectioned mouse hearts, ranging from embryonic day 8.5 to 14.5. The myocardium of the hearts was identified by {ISH} using a mixture of specific {mRNA} probes and reconstructed.},

  abstract={A new imaging technique called optical projection tomography {(OPT),} essentially an optical version of x-ray computed tomography {(CT),} provides molecular specificity, cellular resolution and larger specimen coverage ( approximately 1 cubic centimetre) than was previously possible with other imaging techniques. It is ideally suited to gene expression studies in small animals. Reconstructed {OPT} images demonstrate several artefacts which reduce the overall image quality. In this paper, we describe methods to prevent smear artefacts due to illumination intensity fluctuation, ring artefacts due to {CCD} pixel sensitivity variation and a new 'detector edge' artefact caused by non-zero background signal. We also present an automated method to align the position of the rotational axis during image reconstruction. Finally, we propose a method to eliminate bowl artefacts due to projection truncation using a lower resolution {OPT} scan of the same specimen. This solution also provides {OPT} with the ability to obtain a high-resolution reconstruction from a region of interest of a specimen that is larger than the field of view. Implementation of these corrections and modifications increases the accuracy of the {OPT} imaging technique and extends its capabilities to obtain higher resolution data from within a whole specimen.},

Experimental measurements were acquired using an imaging system consisting of a parallel plate-imaging chamber and a lens coupled charge coupled device camera, which enables conventional planar imaging as well as fluorescence tomography. To simulate increasing levels of background heterogeneity, we employed phantoms made of a fluorescent tube surrounded by several absorbers in different combinations of absorption distribution. We also investigated the effect of low absorbing thin layers (such as membranes). We show that the normalized Born approach accurately retrieves the position and shape of the fluorochrome even at high background heterogeneity. We also demonstrate that the quantification is relatively insensitive to a varying degree of heterogeneity and background optical properties. Findings are further contrasted to images obtained with the standard Born expansion and with a normalized approach that divides the fluorescent field with excitation measurements through a homogeneous medium.}

  abstract={Reconstructing images from a set of fluorescence optical projection tomography {(OPT)} projections is a relatively new problem. Several physical aspects of fluorescence {OPT} necessitate a different treatment of the inverse problem to that required for non-fluorescence tomography. Given a fluorophore within the depth of field of the imaging system, the power received by the optical system, and therefore the {CCD} detector, is related to the distance of the fluorophore from the objective entrance pupil. Additionally, due to the slight blurring of images of sources positioned off the focal plane, the {CCD} image of a fluorophore off the focal plane is lower in intensity than the {CCD} image of an identical fluorophore positioned on the focal plane. The filtered backprojection {(FBP)} algorithm does not take these effects into account and so cannot be expected to yield truly quantitative results. A full model of image formation is introduced which takes into account the effects of isotropic emission and defocus. The model is used to obtain a weighting function which is used in a variation of the {FBP} algorithm called weighted filtered backprojection {(WFBP).} This new algorithm is tested with simulated data and with experimental data from a phantom consisting of fluorescent microspheres embedded in an agarose gel.},

  abstract={Optical-computed tomography {(CT)} and optical-emission computed tomography {(ECT)} are recent techniques with potential for high-resolution multi-faceted {3D} imaging of the structure and function in unsectioned tissue samples up to 1-4 cc. Quantitative imaging of {3D} fluorophore distribution (e.g. {GFP)} using {optical-ECT} is challenging due to attenuation present within the sample. Uncorrected reconstructed images appear hotter near the edges than at the center. A similar effect is seen in {SPECT/PET} imaging, although an important difference is attenuation occurs for both emission and excitation photons. This work presents a way to implement not only the emission attenuation correction utilized in {SPECT,} but also excitation attenuation correction and source strength modeling which are unique to {optical-ECT.} The performance of the correction methods was investigated by the use of a cylindrical gelatin phantom whose central region was filled with a known distribution of attenuation and fluorophores. Uncorrected and corrected reconstructions were compared to a sectioned slice of the phantom imaged using a fluorescent dissecting microscope. Significant attenuation artifacts were observed in uncorrected images and appeared up to 80\% less intense in the central regions due to attenuation and an assumed uniform light source. The corrected reconstruction showed agreement throughout the verification image with only slight variations ( approximately 5\%). Final experiments demonstrate the correction in tissue as applied to a tumor with constitutive {RFP.}},

Recent advances in optical and optoacoustic (photoacoustic) imaging now allow imaging at depths and resolutions unprecedented for optical methods. These abilities are increasingly important to understand the dynamic interactions of cellular processes at different systems levels, a major challenge of postgenome biology. This Review discusses promising photonic methods that have the ability to visualize cellular and subcellular components in tissues across different penetration scales. The methods are classified into microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic approaches, according to the tissue depth at which they operate. Key characteristics associated with different imaging implementations are described and the potential of these technologies in biological applications is discussed.},

  abstract={Optical computed tomography {(optical-CT)} and optical emission computed tomography {(optical-ECT)} are new techniques that enable unprecedented high-resolution {3-D} multimodal imaging of tissue structure and function. Applications include imaging macroscopic gene expression and microvasculature structure in unsectioned biological specimens up to 8 cm(3). A key requisite for these imaging techniques is effective sample preparation including optical clearing, which enables light transport through the sample while preserving the signal (either light absorbing stain or fluorescent proteins) in representative form. We review recent developments in {optical-CT} and {optical-ECT,} and compatible {"}fluorescence-friendly{"} optical clearing protocols.},

Many current techniques for tissue sectioning, imaging and analysis are time-consuming, and they present major limitations for {3D} tissue reconstruction. The introduction of methods to achieve the optical clearing and subsequent light-sheet laser scanning of entire transparent organs without sectioning represents a major advance in the field. We recently developed a highly reproducible and versatile clearing procedure called {3D} imaging of solvent-cleared organs, or {3DISCO,} which is applicable to diverse tissues including brain, spinal cord, immune organs and tumors. Here we describe a detailed protocol for performing {3DISCO} and present its application to various microscopy techniques, including example results from various mouse tissues. The tissue clearing takes as little as 3 h, and imaging can be completed in {\&\#x223C;45} min. {3DISCO} is a powerful technique that offers {3D} histological views of tissues in a fraction of the time and labor required to complete standard histology studies.},

  abstract={Optical computed tomography {(CT),} in conjunction with radiochromic gels and plastics, shows great potential for radiation therapy dose verification in {3D.} However, an effective quality assurance {(QA)} regime for the various scanners currently available still remains to be developed. We show how the favourable properties of the {PRESAGE\&\#xAE;} radiochromic polymer may be exploited to create highly sophisticated {QA} phantoms. Five 60 mm diameter cylindrical {PRESAGE\&\#xAE;} samples were irradiated using the x-ray microbeam radiation therapy facility on the {ID-17} biomedical beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Samples were then imaged on the University of Surrey parallel-beam optical {CT} scanner. The sample irradiations were designed to allow a variety of tests to be performed, including assessments of linearity, modulation transfer function (three independent measurements), geometric distortion and the effect of treatment fractionation. It is clear that, although the synchrotron method produces extremely high-quality test objects, it is not practical on a routine basis, because of its reliance on a highly specialized radiation source. Hence, we investigated a second possibility: three {PRESAGE\&\#xAE;} samples were illuminated with ultraviolet light of wavelength 365 nm, using cheap masks created by laser-printing patterns onto overhead projector acetate sheets. There was good correlation between optical densities measured by the {CT} scanner and the expected {UV} 'dose' delivered. The results are encouraging and a proposal is made for a scanner test regime based on calibrated and well-characterized {PRESAGE\&\#xAE;} samples.},

The {GFP} nude mouse was obtained by crossing nontransgenic nude mice with the transgenic {C57/B6} mouse in which the beta-actin promoter drives {GFP} expression in essentially all tissues. In crosses between nu/nu {GFP} male mice and nu/+ {GFP} female mice, the embryos fluoresced green. Approximately 50\% of the offspring of these mice were {GFP} nude mice. Newborn mice and adult mice fluoresced very bright green and could be detected with a simple blue-light-emitting diode flashlight with a central peak of 470 nm and a bypass emission filter. In the adult mice, the organs all brightly expressed {GFP,} including the heart, lungs, spleen, pancreas, esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. The following systems were dissected out and shown to have brilliant {GFP} fluorescence: the entire digestive system from tongue to anus; the male and female reproductive systems; brain and spinal cord; and the circulatory system, including the heart and major arteries and veins. The skinned skeleton highly expressed {GFP.} Pancreatic islets showed {GFP} fluorescence. The spleen cells were also {GFP} positive. Red fluorescent protein {(RFP)-expressing} human cancer cell lines, including {PC-3-RFP} prostate cancer, {HCT-116-RFP} colon cancer, {MDA-MB-435-RFP} breast cancer, and {HT1080-RFP} fibrosarcoma were transplanted to the transgenic {GFP} nude mice. All of these human tumors grew extensively in the transgenic {GFP} nude mouse. Dual-color fluorescence imaging enabled visualization of human tumor-host interaction by whole-body imaging and at the cellular level in fresh and frozen tissues. The {GFP} mouse model should greatly expand our knowledge of human tumor-host interaction.},

  abstract={The use of fluorescence for cancer detection is currently under investigation. Presently, steady-state fluorescence detection methods are in use, but have limitations due to poor contrast between the fluorescence of the tumor and background autofluorescence. Improved contrast can be obtained with time-resolved techniques because of the differing lifetimes between autofluorescence and exogenous photosensitizers that selectively accumulate within tumor tissue. An imaging system is constructed using a fast-gated (200-ps) charge-coupled device {(CCD)} camera and a pulsed 635-nm laser diode. To characterize the ability of the system to transfer object contrast to an image, the modulation transfer function {(MTF)} of the system is acquired by employing an extended knife-edge technique. A knife-edge target is assembled by drilling a rectangular well into a block of polymethyl methacrylate {(PMMA).} The imaging system records images of the photosensitizer, chloroaluminum phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate {(AlPcTS),} within the well. {AlPcTS} was chosen to test the system because of its strong absorption of 635-nm, high fluorescence yield, and relatively long fluorescence lifetime (approximately 7.5 ns). The results show that the system is capable of resolving 10(-4) M {AlPcTS} fluorescence as small as 1 mm. The findings of this study contribute to the development of a time-gated imaging system using fluorescence lifetimes.},

We show that this new technique allows optical sectioning of fixed mouse brains with cellular resolution and can be used to detect single {GFP-labeled} neurons in excised mouse hippocampi. We obtained three-dimensional {(3D)} images of dendritic trees and spines of populations of {CA1} neurons in isolated hippocampi. Also in fruit flies and in mouse embryos, we were able to visualize details of the anatomy by imaging autofluorescence. Our method is ideally suited for high-throughput phenotype screening of transgenic mice and thus will benefit the investigation of disease models.},

  abstract={This paper aims to identify the minimum requirements for an accurate model of the diffusion {MR} signal in white matter of the brain. We construct a taxonomy of multi-compartment models of white matter from combinations of simple models for the intra- and the extra-axonal spaces. We devise a new diffusion {MRI} protocol that provides measurements with a wide range of imaging parameters for diffusion sensitization both parallel and perpendicular to white matter fibres. We use the protocol to acquire data from two fixed rat brains, which allows us to fit, study and compare the different models. The study examines a total of 47 analytic models, including several well-used models from the literature, which we place within the taxonomy. The results show that models that incorporate intra-axonal restriction, such as ball and stick or {CHARMED,} generally explain the data better than those that do not, such as the {DT} or the biexponential models. However, three-compartment models which account for restriction parallel to the axons and incorporate pore size explain the measurements most accurately. The best fit comes from combining a full diffusion tensor {(DT)} model of the extra-axonal space with a cylindrical intra-axonal component of single radius and a third spherical compartment of non-zero radius. We also measure the stability of the non-zero radius intra-axonal models and find that single radius intra-axonal models are more stable than gamma distributed radii models with similar fitting performance.},

The requirement for effective refractive index matching as part of the scanning process has long been an inconvenience for users, limiting the speed of sample throughput. We propose a new method for reconstructing data that takes explicit account of the refracted path of the light rays and demonstrate theoretically the conditions under which there are sufficient data to create a good reconstruction. Examples of the performance of the algorithm are given. For smoothly varying data, reconstructed images of very high quality are obtained, with {RMS} deviation of under 1\% from the original, provided that the irradiated region lies entirely within a critical radius. For the dosimeter material {PRESAGE,} this critical value is approximately 0.65 of the sample radius. Regions outside this are not reconstructed successfully, but we argue that there are many cases where this disadvantage is outweighed by the benefits of the technique.},

  abstract={Microbeam radiation therapy {(MRT)} uses highly collimated, quasi-parallel arrays of X-ray microbeams of {50-600keV,} produced by third generation synchrotron sources, such as the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility {(ESRF),} in France. The main advantages of highly brilliant synchrotron sources are an extremely high dose rate and very small beam divergence. High dose rates are necessary to deliver therapeutic doses in microscopic volumes, to avoid spreading of the microbeams by cardiosynchronous movement of the tissues. The minimal beam divergence results in the advantage of steeper dose gradients delivered to a tumor target, thus achieving a higher dose deposition in the target volume in fractions of seconds, with a sharper penumbra than that produced in conventional radiotherapy. {MRT} research over the past 20 years has yielded many results from preclinical trials based on different animal models, including mice, rats, piglets and rabbits. Typically, {MRT} uses arrays of narrow ( approximately 25-100 microm wide) microplanar beams separated by wider (100-400 microm centre-to-centre) microplanar spaces. The height of these microbeams typically varies from 1 to 100 mm, depending on the target and the desired preselected field size to be irradiated. Peak entrance doses of several hundreds of Gy are surprisingly well tolerated by normal tissues, up to approximately 2 yr after irradiation, and at the same time show a preferential damage of malignant tumor tissues; these effects of {MRT} have now been extensively studied over nearly two decades. More recently, some biological in vivo effects of synchrotron X-ray beams in the millimeter range (0.68-0.95 mm, centre-to-centre distances 1.2-4 mm), which may differ to some extent from those of microscopic beams, have been followed up to approximately 7 months after irradiation. Comparisons between broad-beam irradiation and {MRT} indicate a higher tumor control for the same sparing of normal tissue in the latter, even if a substantial fraction of tumor cells are not receiving a radiotoxic level of radiation. The hypothesis of a selective radiovulnerability of the tumor vasculature versus normal blood vessels by {MRT,} and of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved remains under investigation. The paper highlights the history of {MRT} including salient biological findings after microbeam irradiation with emphasis on the vascular components and the tolerance of the central nervous system. Details on experimental and theoretical dosimetry of microbeams, core issues and possible therapeutic applications of {MRT} are presented.},

  abstract={Microbeam radiation therapy {(MRT)} has the potential to treat infantile brain tumours when other kinds of radiotherapy would be excessively toxic to the developing normal brain. {MRT} uses extraordinarily high doses of x-rays but provides unusual resistance to radioneurotoxicity, presumably from the migration of endothelial cells from 'valleys' into 'peaks', i.e., into directly irradiated microslices of tissues. We present a novel irradiation geometry which results in a tolerable valley dose for the normal tissue and a decreased peak-to-valley dose ratio {(PVDR)} in the tumour area by applying an innovative cross-firing technique. We propose an {MRT} technique to orthogonally crossfire two arrays of parallel, nonintersecting, mutually interspersed microbeams that produces tumouricidal doses with small {PVDRs} where the arrays meet and tolerable radiation doses to normal tissues between the microbeams proximal and distal to the tumour in the paths of the arrays.},

  abstract={Optical tomography of gel dosimeters is a promising and cost-effective avenue for quality control of radiotherapy treatments such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy {(IMRT).} Systems based on a laser coupled to a photodiode have so far shown the best results within the context of optical scanning of radiosensitive gels, but are very slow ( approximately 9 min per slice) and poorly suited to measurements that require many slices. Here, we describe a fast, three-dimensional {(3D)} optical computed tomography {(optical-CT)} apparatus, based on a broad, collimated beam, obtained from a high power {LED} and detected by a charged coupled detector {(CCD).} The main advantages of such a system are (i) an acquisition speed approximately two orders of magnitude higher than a laser-based system when {3D} data are required, and (ii) a greater simplicity of design. This paper advances our previous work by introducing a new design of focusing optics, which take information from a suitably positioned focal plane and project an image onto the {CCD.} An analysis of the ray optics is presented, which explains the roles of telecentricity, focusing, acceptance angle and depth-of-field {(DOF)} in the formation of projections. A discussion of the approximation involved in measuring the line integrals required for filtered backprojection reconstruction is given. Experimental results demonstrate (i) the effect on projections of changing the position of the focal plane of the apparatus, (ii) how to measure the acceptance angle of the optics, and (iii) the ability of the new scanner to image both absorbing and scattering gel phantoms. The quality of reconstructed images is very promising and suggests that the new apparatus may be useful in a clinical setting for fast and accurate {3D} dosimetry.},

To ensure good management of light source-detector stability, it was determined that (a) a minimum of 2 h warm-up time is necessary prior to dosimeter scanning, (b) the light source should be kept on until the completion of the last data scan except for the minimum amount of time required to acquire dark field images, and (c) the optional Vista software projection image normalization routine should be used in image reconstruction. The institution of dosimeter scan time and temperature control was strongly indicated from the experiments. A standard post-irradiation wait time of 30 min measured to within {\&\#xB1;30} s was established to minimize the measurement uncertainties due to dosimeter development and diffusion. To alleviate thermochromic behavior leading to inaccurate dose readout, holding bath warm up and pre-scan temperature adjustment procedures were developed to control dosimeter temperature to within {\&\#xB1;0.2} {\&\#xB0;C.} The possibility of stray light minimizing protocols was also investigated and deemed to be unnecessary. The largest significant sources of stray light in the system were identified as being due to angled scatter from the dosimeter gelatin matrix and refraction from the jar wall interfaces. It was concluded that these phenomena would be better addressed through dosimeter modification and an inter-jar dose-to-attenuation calibration methodology, rather than by setting additional imaging protocols.},

The aim of this review is to introduce the subject of molecular imaging from both life science and physical science perspectives. However, we will restrict our coverage to the prominent in vivo molecular imaging modalities of magnetic resonance imaging, optical imaging and nuclear imaging. The physical basis of these imaging modalities, the use of contrast agents and the imaging parameters of sensitivity, temporal resolution and spatial resolution are described. Then, the specificity of contrast agents for targeting and sensing molecular events, and some applications of molecular imaging in biology and medicine are given.

  abstract={A method for determining the gel sensitivity that is necessary for obtaining optimal image contrast in optical {CT} scanning of gel dosimeters is presented. The effective dynamic range of the {OCTOPUS-ONE} research scanner {(MGS} Research, Inc., Madison, {CT)} is analyzed. Optical density increments for selected straight-line paths across a gel cylinder to be scanned are calculated based on the optical properties of the polymer gel and the dose distribution from a commercial treatment planning system {(Cadplan,} Varian Corporation, Palo Alto, {CA).} Maximum optical density increment across the entire gel is obtained by searching the gel cylinder over a set of transverse planes at different rotational angles. The application of this quantity as a criterion for optimizing the quality of the optical {CT} scanning is demonstrated through dose verification of two representative treatment plans. When the {MU} dependence of the dose distribution for a treatment plan is linear, as is the case for static field irradiation, it is possible to scale the treatment plan such that the intensity variation of the signals received by the photodetector spans its entire dynamic range. For treatment plans that are possibly nonlinear, {IMRT} plans, for example, modification of the sensitivity of the gel material is necessary for the high-dose signals to be collected at a certain signal-to-noise ratio. Results obtained using the optimized {CT} scanning approach are compared with those from the treatment planning system and the film measurement.},

  abstract={Absorption and emission optical projection tomography {(OPT),} alternatively referred to as optical computed tomography {(optical-CT)} and optical-emission computed tomography {(optical-ECT),} are recently developed three-dimensional imaging techniques with value for developmental biology and ex vivo gene expression studies. The techniques' principles are similar to the ones used for x-ray computed tomography and are based on the approximation of negligible light scattering in optically cleared samples. The optical clearing is achieved by a chemical procedure which aims at substituting the cellular fluids within the sample with a cell membranes' index matching solution. Once cleared the sample presents very low scattering and is then illuminated with a light collimated beam whose intensity is captured in transillumination mode by a {CCD} camera. Different projection images of the sample are subsequently obtained over a 360 degrees full rotation, and a standard backprojection algorithm can be used in a similar fashion as for x-ray tomography in order to obtain absorption maps. Because not all biological samples present significant absorption contrast, it is not always possible to obtain projections with a good signal-to-noise ratio, a condition necessary to achieve high-quality tomographic reconstructions. Such is the case for example, for early stage's embryos. In this work we demonstrate how, through the use of a random noise removal algorithm, the image quality of the reconstructions can be considerably improved even when the noise is strongly present in the acquired projections. Specifically, we implemented a block matching {3D} {(BM3D)} filter applying it separately on each acquired transillumination projection before performing a complete three-dimensional tomographical reconstruction. To test the efficiency of the adopted filtering scheme, a phantom and a real biological sample were processed. In both cases, the {BM3D} filter led to a signal-to-noise ratio increment of over 30 {dB} on severe noise-affected reconstructions revealing original-noise-hidden-image details. These results show the utility of the {BM3D} approach for {OPT} under typical conditions of very low light absorption, suggesting its implementation as an efficient alternative to other filtering schemes such as for example the median filter.},

The low efficiency can result in radiation dose dependent artifacts such as photobleaching and phototoxicity. To minimize these effects as well as artifacts introduced due to the use of a {CCD-} or {CMOS-} camera-chip, we constructed a Scanning Laser Optical Tomograph {(SLOT).} Compared to conventional fluorescence {OPT} our first {SLOT} enhanced the photon collection efficiency a hundredfold.}

  abstract={The optical clearing technique has shown great potential in improving light penetration into biotissues. Among various optical clearing agents {(OCAs)} under study, the hydroxyl-terminated agents induce the highest optical clearing effect of skin, but the exact mechanism of optical clearing is still unclear. In consideration of several probable factors, such as the number of hydroxyl groups, the refractive index, and the molecular weight, we investigate the optical clearing effect of porcine skin after applying six alcohols to the epidermis and saline to the dermis. The dynamical transmission intensity of porcine skin is monitored by an integrating sphere system, and the thickness of skin samples is measured before and after experiments. The results show that the transmittance of skin increases significantly, but there is no significant change in thickness after the treatment of {OCAs.} The optical clearing effect of skin induced by alcohols is related to the number of hydroxyl groups. The refractive index or molecular weight of optical clearing agents does not correlate with the degree of optical clearing effect for a 60-min time interval of measurement. However, the behavior of skin transmittance after 60 min needs to be further investigated.},

Transmission electron microscopy images reveal that dehydration causes individual scattering particles such as collagen fibrils and organelles to become more densely packed, but does not significantly alter size.

In this research, we have developed a new method of using light microscopy for penetrative three-dimensional {(3-D)} visualization of scaffolds formed by collagen, chitosan, or cellulose. First, we applied an optical-clearing solution, {FocusClear,} to permeate and reduce the turbidity of the scaffolds. The improved photon penetration allowed fluorophores for efficient excitation and emission in the {FocusClear} solution. Confocal microscopy was applied to achieve cellular-level resolution up to 350 microm for both the fibroblast/collagen and the osteoblast/chitosan constructs and micrometer-level resolution up to 40 microm for the cellulose membrane. The depth of imaging of the cellulose membrane was further improved to 80 microm using two-photon microscopy. Significantly, these voxel-based confocal/two-photon micrographs allowed postrecording image processing via Amira projection algorithms for {3-D} visualization and analysis of the scanned region. Although this optical method remains limited in viewing block scaffolds in thin sections, our approach provides a noninvasive way to microscopically examine the scaffold structure, which would be a valuable tool to studying biomaterials and their interactions with the molecule/cell of interest within the scaffold in an integrated fashion.},

  abstract={The concept of refractive-index matching to enhance the optical penetration depth of whole blood is discussed on the basis of in vitro studies that used the technique of near-infrared optical coherence tomography. It was found that optical clearing of blood is defined not only by refractive-index matching but also by changes in the size of red blood cells and in their aggregation ability when chemicals are added. For example, in whole blood diluted to twice its volume by saline with the addition of 6.5\% glycerol, the total attenuation coefficient was reduced from 4.2 to 2.0 mm(-1), and the optical penetration at 820 nm was correspondingly increased to 117\%. For the other agents tested (glucose, dextrans, propylene glycol, and trazograph) the enhancement of penetration was 20-150.5\%. In the blood sedimentation study, regular or irregular oscillations or jumps of the red-blood cell-plasma boundary were observed. The 1-min time period of regular oscillations correlated well with the kinetics of the aggregation process as described by the two subsequent stages of formation of linear and three-dimensional aggregates. The results also showed that optical clearing of blood by osmotic agents is potentially useful not only in blood sedimentation and aggregation studies but also in intravascular optical coherence tomography imaging techniques.}

  abstract={Reduction of optical scattering in turbid biological tissues using nonreactive chemical agents has potential applications for light-based diagnostics and therapeutics. Optical clearing effects by exogenous chemical agents, in particular sugars and sugar alcohols, have been found to be temporary with tissue rehydration. Applications with dermatologic laser therapies are now being investigated, but suffer from the inability of studied agents to penetrate the superficial layers of human skin. Selection, design, and refinement of topically effective chemical agents are hindered by a lack of fundamental understanding of tissue clearing mechanisms. We present recent work, particularly from the biochemistry community, detailing molecular interactions between chemical agents and collagen. This body of work demonstrates the perturbative effects of sugars and sugar alcohols on collagen high-order structures at micro- and nanometer length scales by screening noncovalent bonding forces. In addition, these studies emphasize the nonreactive nature of agent-collagen interactions and the ability of noncovalent bonding forces to recover with agent removal and drive reassembly of destabilized collagen structures. A mechanism of tissue optical clearing is proposed based on agent destabilization of high-order collagen structures.},

  abstract={Given that optical tomography is capable of quantitatively imaging the distribution of several important chromophores and fluorophores in vivo, there has been a great deal of interest in developing optical imaging systems with increased numbers of measurements under optimal experimental conditions. In this article, we present a novel system that enables three-dimensional imaging of fluorescent probes in whole animals using a noncontact setup, in parallel with a three-dimensional surface reconstruction algorithm. This approach is directed toward the in vivo imaging of fluorophore or fluorescent protein concentration in small animals. The system consists of a rotating sample holder and a lens-coupled charge-coupled device camera in combination with a fiber-coupled laser scanning device. By measuring multiple projections, large data sets can be obtained, thus improving the accuracy of the inversion models used for quantitative three-dimensional reconstruction of fluorochrome distribution, as well as facilitating a higher spatial resolution. In this study, the system was applied to determining the distribution of green fluorescent protein {(GFP)-expressing} T lymphocytes in a transgenic mouse model, thus demonstrating the potential of the system for studying immune system function. The technique was used to image and reconstruct fluorescence originating from 32 x 10(6) T cells in the thymus and 3 x 10(5) T cells in the spleen.}

  abstract={A new iterative center weighted median filter {(ICWMF)} for ring artifact reduction from the micro-computed tomographic {(micro-CT)} image is proposed in this paper. The center weight of the median filter is computed based on the characteristic of the ring artifact in the mean curve of the projection data. The filter operates on the deviation of the mean curve to smooth the ring generating peaks and troughs iteratively while preserving the details due to image. A convergence criterion for the iterative algorithm is determined from the distribution of the local deviation computed from the mean curve deviation. The estimate of the mean curve obtained using the {ICWMF} is used to correct the ring corrupted projection data from which reconstruction gives the ring artifact suppressed {micro-CT} image. Test results on both the synthetic and real images demonstrate that the ring artifacts can be more effectively suppressed using our method as compared to other ring removal techniques reported in the literature.},

In addition to phantom studies, the proposed technique was particularly applied to and studied in the task of clinical Rb-82 myocardial perfusion imaging, which presently suffers from poor statistics and resolution properties in the reconstructed images. Overall, the approach is able to produce considerable enhancements in image quality. The reconstructed {FWHM} for a Discovery {RX} {PET/CT} scanner was seen to improve from 5.1 mm to 7.7 mm across the field-of-view {(FoV)} to approximately 3.5 mm nearly uniformly across the {FoV.} Furthermore, extended-source phantom studies indicated clearly improved images in terms of contrast versus noise performance. Using Monte Carlo simulations of clinical Rb-82 imaging, the resolution modeling technique was seen to significantly outperform standard reconstructions qualitatively, and also quantitatively in terms of contrast versus noise (contrast between the myocardium and other organs, as well as between myocardial defects and the left ventricle).},

  abstract={Due to malfunctioning and mis-calibration of cells in digital x-ray detectors as well as impurities on the scintillator screens, stripe artifacts arise in the sinogram which in turn generate ring artifacts in the reconstructed x-ray computed tomography images. In this paper, a novel technique is proposed for the detection and removal of stripe artifacts in a sinogram with a view to suppress the ring artifacts from the tomographic images. To accurately detect the stripe creating pixels using a derivative-based algorithm, at first the sinogram is windowed to create a sub-sinogram by keeping the pixel of examination at the center position in the sub-sinogram. The other pixels in the sub-sinogram are selected from a polyphase component of the sinogram. A new mathematical index is proposed here to isolate the strong and weak ring-generating stripes from the good ones. For the correction of strong ring artifacts resulting from the defective detector elements and dusty scintillator crystals, {2D} variable window moving average and weighted moving average filters are proposed in this work. On the other hand, a conventionally trusted constant bias correction scheme is adopted to correct the responses of the mis-calibrated detector elements. To evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed algorithm, real {micro-CT} images acquired from two flat panel detectors under different operating conditions are used. Experimental results show that the proposed method can remove ring artifacts more effectively without imparting noticeable distortion in the image as compared to a recently reported technique in the literature.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present an interactive high dynamic range volume visualization framework {(HDR} {VolVis)} for visualizing volumetric data with both high spatial and intensity resolutions. Volumes with high dynamic range values require high precision computing during the rendering process to preserve data precision. Furthermore, it is desirable to render high resolution volumes with low opacity values to reveal detailed internal structures, which also requires high precision compositing. High precision rendering will result in a high precision intermediate image (also known as high dynamic range image). Simply rounding up pixel values to regular display scales will result in loss of computed details. Our method performs high precision compositing followed by dynamic tone mapping to preserve details on regular display devices. Rendering high precision volume data requires corresponding resolution in the transfer function. To assist the users in designing a high resolution transfer function on a limited resolution display device, we propose a novel transfer function specification interface with nonlinear magnification of the density range and logarithmic scaling of the color/ opacity range. By leveraging modern commodity graphics hardware, multiresolution rendering techniques and out-of-core acceleration, our system can effectively produce an interactive visualization of large volume data, such as 2,048(3).},

However, the slow convergence and the high computational cost for its practical implementation have limited its clinical applications. This study proposes the incorporation of a thresholding technique in both the {MLEM} and ordered subsets {EM} {(OSEM)} algorithm to accelerate convergence. The threshold is set to c*m, where m is the mean pixel value of the whole image. The reconstruction time is proportional to the total number of pixels, so a thresholding technique that nullifies the value of a pixel if it falls below a threshold, can effectively remove the non-active pixels and substantially accelerate reconstruction. Preliminary tests on simulated {PET} data reveal that the thresholding technique accelerates the convergence rate and reduce error in the reconstructed image. The reconstruction performance improves with the increase of the threshold level and the {MSE} reaches minimum for c value equals to about 1.},

In order to reduce the residual absorption artifact (due to the fact that only one data set is used) the original algorithm presented by A. V. Bronnikov is amended by adding in the filter a factor found by using a semi empirical approach. The quality of the reconstruction is largely sufficient for optimal segmentation and further postprocessing even though the filter correction is based on assumption of constant absorption. This one step approach allows keeping radiation dose to the minimum. Spatial resolution is comparable to the conventional absorption based technique. The performance of the method is validated by using an established phase contrast technique.}

This was despite generous passing criteria (within 7\% dose-difference or 4mm distance-to-agreement) evaluated at a half-dozen points and a single axial plane. The question that arises from this disturbing finding is - what percentage of institutions would have failed if a comprehensive {3D} measurement had been feasible, rather than measurements restricted to the central film-plane and {TLD} points? This question can only be adequately answered by a comprehensive {3D-dosimetry} system, which presents a compelling argument for its development as a clinically viable low cost dosimetry solution. {Optical-CT} dosimetry is perhaps the closest system to providing such a comprehensive solution. In this article, we review the origins and recent developments of {optical-CT} dosimetry systems.

  abstract={Optical transillumination tomography {(OT)} is a laser-based imaging modality where ballistic photons are used for projection generation. Image reconstruction is therefore similar to X-ray computed tomography. This modality promises fast image acquisition, good resolution and contrast, and inexpensive instrumentation for imaging of weakly scattering objects, such as for example tissue-engineered constructs. In spite of its advantages, {OT} is not widely used. One reason is its sensitivity towards changes in material refractive index along the light path. Beam refraction artefacts cause areas of overestimated tissue density and blur geometric details. A spatial filter, introduced into the beam path to eliminate scattered photons, will also remove refracted photons from the projections. In the projections, zones affected by refraction can be detected by thresholding. By using algebraic reconstruction techniques {(ART)} in conjunction with suitable interpolation algorithms, reconstruction artefacts can be partly avoided. Reconstructions from a test image were performed. Standard filtered backprojection {(FBP)} showed a round mean square {(RMS)} deviation from the original image of 9.9. {RMS} deviation with refraction-tolerant {ART} reconstruction was 0.33 and 0.24, depending on the algorithm, compared to 0.57 {(FBP)} and 0.06 {(ART)} in a non-refracting case. In addition, modified {ART} reconstruction allowed detection of small geometric details that were invisible in standard reconstructions. Refraction-tolerant {ART} may be the key to eliminating one of the major challenges of {OT.}},

However, practicalities such as tissue opacity, light penetration, and detector sensitivity have usually limited the available depth of imaging to 200 microm. With the emergence of newer, more powerful systems, we attempted to push these limits to those dictated by the working distance of the objective. We used whole-mount immunohistochemical staining followed by clearing with benzyl alcohol-benzyl benzoate {(BABB)} to visualize three-dimensional myocardial architecture. Confocal imaging of entire chick embryonic hearts up to a depth of 1.5 mm with voxel dimensions of 3 microm was achieved with a 10x dry objective. For the purpose of screening for congenital heart defects, we used endocardial painting with fluorescently labeled {poly-L-lysine} and imaged {BABB-cleared} hearts with a 5x objective up to a depth of 2 mm. Two-photon imaging of whole-mount specimens stained with Hoechst nuclear dye produced clear images all the way through stage 29 hearts without significant signal attenuation. Thus, currently available systems allow confocal imaging of fixed samples to previously unattainable depths, the current limiting factors being objective working distance, antibody penetration, specimen autofluorescence, and incomplete clearing.},

These have been proposed to be of particular value in mapping radiation dose distributions associated with emerging and complex approaches to cancer treatment such as conformal {(CRT),} intensity modulated {(IMRT),} {"}gamma knife,{"} and pencil beam radiotherapies. Imaging of the gels has been successfully accomplished with clinical {MRI} units and via laser-based optical scanning. However, neither of these methods is generally accessible to all potential users, limiting the broader study and implementation of this valuable tool. We report here the design, methodology, and results of a preliminary study carried out to evaluate the utility of a new, inexpensive, and simplified approach to tomographic imaging of gel radiation dosimeters. For the purpose of this initial investigation, an array of liquid scintillation vials was prepared, containing a ferrous sulphate xylenol orange {(FSX)} gelatin formulation. The {FSX} formulation undergoes a change in optical absorption characteristics following irradiation, and the resulting color change can be observed visually. The vials were irradiated individually to different doses. Three-dimensional imaging was accomplished by tomographic reconstruction from two-dimensional optical images acquired using a diffuse, fluorescent light source, a digital charge-coupled device camera, single-photon-emission-computed tomography software, and other simple components designed by the authors. The resulting transverse images were evaluated through a region-of-interest {(ROI)} analysis to obtain the average change in image density in each vial as a function of radiation dose. These measured {ROI} values were subjected to a linear regression analysis to fit them to a straight line, and to determine the goodness of fit. Results from multiple imaging trials are compared. The correlation coefficients obtained are typically on the order of 0.98, and the p value from analysis of variance is approximately 0.05, indicating a linear and reproducible response for the dosimeter formulation and imaging system.}

  abstract={Purpose: The objective of this work is to introduce a prototype fan-beam optical computed tomography scanner for three-dimensional {(3D)} radiation {dosimetry.Methods:} Two techniques of fan-beam creation were evaluated: a helium-neon laser {(HeNe,} {\&\#x3BB;} = 543 nm) with line-generating lens, and a laser diode module {(LDM,} {\&\#x3BB;} = 635 nm) with line-creating head module. Two physical collimator designs were assessed: a single-slot collimator and a multihole collimator. Optimal collimator depth was determined by observing the signal of a single photodiode with varying collimator depths. A method of extending the dynamic range of the system is presented. Two sample types were used for evaluations: nondosimetric absorbent solutions and irradiated polymer gel dosimeters, each housed in 1 liter cylindrical plastic flasks. Imaging protocol investigations were performed to address ring artefacts and image noise. Two image artefact removal techniques were performed in sinogram space. Collimator efficacy was evaluated by imaging highly opaque samples of scatter-based and absorption-based solutions. A noise-based flask registration technique was developed. Two protocols for gel manufacture were {examined.Results:} The {LDM} proved advantageous over the {HeNe} laser due to its reduced noise. Also, the {LDM} uses a wavelength more suitable for the {PRESAGE(TM)} dosimeter. Collimator depth of 1.5 cm was found to be an optimal balance between scatter rejection, signal strength, and manufacture ease. The multihole collimator is capable of maintaining accurate scatter-rejection to high levels of opacity with scatter-based solutions {(T} \&lt; 0.015\%). Imaging protocol investigations support the need for preirradiation and postirradiation scanning to reduce reflection-based ring artefacts and to accommodate flask imperfections and gel inhomogeneities. Artefact removal techniques in sinogram space eliminate streaking artefacts and reduce ring artefacts of up to {\&\#x223C;40\%} in magnitude. The flask registration technique was shown to achieve submillimetre and subdegree placement accuracy. Dosimetry protocol investigations emphasize the need to allow gel dosimeters to cool gradually and to be scanned while at room temperature. Preliminary tests show that considerable noise reduction can be achieved with sinogram filtering and by binning image pixels into more clinically relevant grid {sizes.Conclusions:} This paper describes a new optical {CT} scanner for {3D} radiation dosimetry. Tests demonstrate that it is capable of imaging both absorption-based and scatter-based samples of high opacities. Imaging protocol and gel dosimeter manufacture techniques have been adapted to produce optimal reconstruction results. These optimal results will require suitable filtering and binning techniques for noise reduction purposes.},

  abstract={There is a clear need for technology that enables accurate, high-resolution, three-dimensional {(3D)} measurement of intricate dose distributions associated with modern radiation treatments. A potential candidate has emerged in the form of water-equivalent {{"}3D} gel dosimetry{"} utilizing optical-computed-tomography {(optical-CT).} In a previous paper we presented basic physical characterization of an in-house prototype {optical-CT} scanning system. The present paper builds on that work by investigating sources of optical artifacts and geometric distortion in {optical-CT} scanning. Improvements in scanner design are described. Correction strategies were developed to compensate for reflection and refraction, imperfections in the water-bath, signal drift, and other effects. Refraction and reflection were identified as the principal factors causing inaccurate reconstruction of absolute attenuation coefficients. A correction specific to a given flask was developed utilizing prescans of the flask when filled with water-bath fluid, thereby isolating the refractive and reflective components for that flask. Residual artifacts were corrected by fitting a theoretical model to the well-behaved portion of these prescans and extrapolating to regions of lost data, enabling reconstruction of absolute {optical-CT} attenuation coefficients to within 4\% of corresponding spectrophotometer values. Needle phantoms are introduced to quantify geometric distortion under a range of conditions. Radial distortion of reconstructed needle positions was reduced to \&lt; 0.3 mm (0.27\% of the field of view) through adjustment of the water-bath refractive index. Geometric distortion in polymer gel due to radiation-induced refractive index changes was found to be negligible under the conditions examined. The influence of scattered light on reconstructed attenuation coefficients was investigated by repeat {optical-CT} scans while varying the aperture of a scatter-rejecting collimator. Significant depression of reconstructed attenuation coefficients was observed, particularly under conditions of poor scatter rejection collimation. The general conclusion is that the first-generation {optical-CT} technique can be made insensitive to geometrical distortion, but can be susceptible to scatter effects. For accurate reconstruction of absolute attenuation coefficients, correction strategies are essential.}

An additional modality has received much less attention: Optical transillumination {(OT)} tomography, a modality that promises very high acquisition speed for volumetric scans. With the motivation to image tissue-engineered blood vessels for possible biomechanical testing, we have developed a fast {OT} device using a collimated, noncoherent beam with a large diameter together with a large-size {CMOS} camera that has the ability to acquire {3D} projections in a single revolution of the sample. In addition, we used accelerated iterative reconstruction techniques to improve image reconstruction speed, while at the same time obtaining better image quality than through filtered backprojection. The device was tested using ink-filled polytetrafluorethylene tubes to determine geometric reconstruction accuracy and recovery of absorbance. Even in the presence of minor refractive index mismatch, the weighted error of the measured radius was \&lt;5\% in all cases, and a high linear correlation of ink absorbance determined with a photospectrometer of R(2) = 0.99 was found, although the {OT} device systematically underestimated absorbance. Reconstruction time was improved from several hours (standard arithmetic reconstruction) to 90 s per slice with our optimized algorithm. Composed of only a light source, two spatial filters, a sample bath, and a {CMOS} camera, this device was extremely simple and cost-efficient to build.},

  abstract={Molecular imaging is a relatively new discipline, which developed over the past decade, initially driven by in situ reporter imaging technology. Noninvasive in vivo molecular imaging developed more recently and is based on magnetic resonance and nuclear (positron emission tomography; gamma camera) and in vivo optical imaging systems. Molecular imaging has its roots in both molecular biology and cell biology, as well as imaging technology. Most current in vivo molecular imaging strategies are {"}indirect{"} and involve the coupling of a {"}reporter/marker gene{"} with a complimentary {"}reporter/marker probe.{"} Imaging the level of probe accumulation provides indirect information related to the level of reporter gene expression. Reporter gene constructs are driven by upstream promoter/enhancer elements that function as an {"}on/off switch{"}; they can be constitutive, leading to continuous transcription to identify the site and monitor the level and duration of gene (vector) activity. Alternatively, they can be inducible, leading to controlled gene expression, or they can function as a sensor element to monitor the level of endogenous promoters and transcription factors. Three indirect strategies for imaging therapeutic transgenes are discussed. Several examples of imaging endogenous biological processes in animals using reporter constructs, radiolabeled probes, and positron emission tomography imaging are reviewed (p53-dependent gene expression, T-cell receptor-dependent activation of T-lymphocytes, and trafficking of T-lymphocytes). Issues related to the translation of noninvasive molecular imaging technology into the clinic are discussed.}

The coupling of nuclear and optical reporter genes, as described here, represents only the beginning of a far wider application of this technology in the future. Optical imaging and optical reporter systems are cost-effective and time-efficient; they require less resources and space than {PET} or {MRI,} and are particularly well suited for imaging small animals, such as mice. Optical reporter systems are also very useful for the quantification and selection of transduced cells using {FACS,} and for performing in vitro assays to validate the function and sensitivity of constitutive and specific-inducible reporter systems. However, optical imaging techniques are limited by depth of light penetration and do not yet provide optimal quantitative or tomographic information. These issues are not limiting for {PET-} or {MRI-based} reporter systems, and {PET-} and {MRI-based} animal studies are more easily generalized to human applications. Many of the shortcomings of each modality alone can be overcome by the use of dual- or triple-modality reporter constructs that incorporate the opportunity for {PET,} fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging.},

It would aid in understanding the role specific genes and signal transduction pathways have in various diseases, and could elucidate temporal dynamics and regulation at different stages of disease and during various therapeutic interventions. We developed and assessed a method for monitoring the transcriptional activation of endogenous genes by positron-emission tomography {(PET)} imaging. The {HSV1-tk/GFP} {(TKGFP)} dual reporter gene was used to monitor transcriptional activation of p53-dependent genes. A retrovirus bearing the {Cis-p53/TKGFP} reporter system was constructed in which the {TKGFP} reporter gene was placed under control of an artificial cis-acting p53-specific enhancer. U87 glioma and {SaOS-2} osteosarcoma cells were transduced with this retrovirus and used to establish xenografts in rats. We demonstrated that {DNA} damage-induced up-regulation of p53 transcriptional activity correlated with the expression of p53-dependent downstream genes, such as p21, in U87 (wild-type p53), but not in {SaOS-2} osteosarcoma (p53 -/-) cells. We showed that {PET,} with {[(124)I]FIAU} {(2'-fluoro-2'-deoxy-1-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl-5-[(124)I]iodouracil)} and the {Cis-p53TKGFP} reporter system, is sufficiently sensitive to image the transcriptional regulation of genes in the p53 signal transduction pathway. These imaging results were confirmed by independent measurements of p53 activity and the expression levels of downstream genes (e.g., p21) by using conventional molecular-biological assays. {PET} imaging of p53 transcriptional activity in tumor xenografts by using the {Cis-p53TKGFP} reporter system may be useful in assessing novel therapeutic approaches.},

Our method produces speedups of about an order of magnitude over a previously proposed {GPU-based} {ET} implementation, on similar hardware, and completes an iterative {3D} reconstruction of practical problem size within minutes. We also describe a novel {GPU-amenable} approach that effectively compensates for reconstruction errors resulting from the {TEM} data acquisition on (long) samples which extend the width of the parallel {TEM} beam. We show that the vignetting artifacts typically arising at the periphery of non-compensated {ET} reconstructions are completely eliminated when our method is employed.},

  abstract={The recent emergence of radiochromic dosimeters with low inherent light-scattering presents the possibility of fast {3D} dosimetry using broad-beam optical computed tomography {(optical-CT).} Current broad beam scanners typically employ either a single or a planar array of light-emitting diodes {(LED)} for the light source. The spectrum of light from {LED} sources is polychromatic and this, in combination with the non-uniform spectral absorption of the dosimeter, can introduce spectral artifacts arising from preferential absorption of photons at the peak absorption wavelengths in the dosimeter. Spectral artifacts can lead to large errors in the reconstructed attenuation coefficients, and hence dose measurement. This work presents an analytic method for correcting for spectral artifacts which can be applied if the spectral characteristics of the light source, absorbing dosimeter, and imaging detector are known or can be measured. The method is implemented here for a {PRESAGE\&\#xAE;} dosimeter scanned with the {DLOS} telecentric scanner {(Duke} Large field-of-view {Optical-CT} Scanner). Emission and absorption profiles were measured with a commercial spectrometer and spectrophotometer, respectively. Simulations are presented that show spectral changes can introduce errors of 8\% for moderately attenuating samples where spectral artifacts are less pronounced. The correction is evaluated by application to a 16 cm diameter {PRESAGE\&\#xAE;} cylindrical dosimeter irradiated along the axis with two partially overlapping 6 {\&\#xD7;} 6 cm fields of different doses. The resulting stepped dose distribution facilitates evaluation of the correction as each step had different spectral contributions. The spectral artifact correction was found to accurately correct the reconstructed coefficients to within {\&\#x223C;1.5\%,} improved from {\&\#x223C;7.5\%,} for normalized dose distributions. In conclusion, for situations where spectral artifacts cannot be removed by physical filters, the method shown here is an effective correction. Physical filters may be less viable if they introduce strong sensitivity to Schlieren bands in the dosimeters.},

  abstract={Confocal laser scanning microscopy combined with a vital stain has been used to study apoptosis in organogenesis-stage mouse embryos. In order to achieve optical sectioning through embryos, it was necessary to use low power objectives and to prepare the sample appropriately. Mouse embryos were harvested on gestation day 8 or 9 and stained with the vital lysosomal dye, {LysoTracker} Red. Following incubation in the stain, embryos were fixed in 2\% paraformaldehyde overnight, dehydrated in a graded methanol series, and cleared in benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate. The resulting embryo is almost transparent and retains specific {LysoTracker} Red staining. The entire embryo can be optically sectioned and reconstructed in three dimensions to reveal areas of dye staining. To test this approach, the chemotherapeutic drug hydroxyurea was added to day 8 embryos in vitro to induce apoptosis. Our results demonstrated specific regions undergoing programmed cell death in normal development and increased apoptosis in embryos exposed to hydroxyurea. The observed patterns of {LysoTracker} Red staining correlate well with previous studies of cell death using other lysosomotropic dyes such as Nile blue sulfate, acridine orange, or neutral red. {LysoTracker} Red has the advantages of being aldehyde-fixable and highly fluorescent (bleaching was not observed even after multiple scans). This procedure allows for the optical imaging of whole day 9 (approximately 22 somites) embryos that were greater than 500 microns thick in the Z-axis.},

  abstract={This study introduces a charge coupled device {(CCD)} area detector based optical-computed tomography {(optical-CT)} scanner for comprehensive verification of radiation dose distributions recorded in nonscattering radiochromic dosimeters. Defining characteristics include: (i) a very fast scanning time of approximately 5 min to acquire a complete three-dimensional {(3D)} dataset, (ii) improved image formation through the use of custom telecentric optics, which ensures accurate projection images and minimizes artifacts from scattered and stray-light sources, and (iii) high resolution (potentially 50 microm) isotropic {3D} dose readout. The performance of the {CCD} scanner for {3D} dose readout was evaluated by comparison with independent {3D} readout from the single laser beam {OCTOPUS-scanner} for the same {PRESAGE} dosimeters. The {OCTOPUS} scanner was considered the {"}gold standard{"} technique in light of prior studies demonstrating its accuracy. Additional comparisons were made against calculated dose distributions from the {ECLIPSE} treatment-planning system. Dose readout for the following treatments were investigated: (i) a single rectangular beam irradiation to investigate small field and very steep dose gradient dosimetry away from edge effects, (ii) a 2-field open beam parallel-opposed irradiation to investigate dosimetry along steep dose gradients, and (iii) a 7-field intensity modulated radiation therapy {(IMRT)} irradiation to investigate dosimetry for complex treatment delivery involving modulation of fluence and for dosimetry along moderate dose gradients. Dose profiles, dose-difference plots, and gamma maps were employed to evaluate quantitative estimates of agreement between independently measured and calculated dose distributions. Results indicated that dose readout from the {CCD} scanner was in agreement with independent gold-standard readout from the {OCTOPUS-scanner} as well as the calculated {ECLIPSE} dose distribution for all treatments, except in regions within a few millimeters of the edge of the dosimeter, where edge artifact is predominant. Agreement of line profiles was observed, even along steep dose gradients. Dose difference plots indicated that the {CCD} scanner dose readout differed from the {OCTOPUS} scanner readout and {ECLIPSE} calculations by approximately 10\% along steep dose gradients and by approximately 5\% along moderate dose gradients. Gamma maps (3\% dose-difference and 3 mm distance-to-agreement acceptance criteria) revealed agreement, except for regions within 5 mm of the edge of the dosimeter where the edge artifact occurs. In summary, the data demonstrate feasibility of using the fast, high-resolution {CCD} scanner for comprehensive {3D} dosimetry in all applications, except where dose readout is required close to the edges of the dosimeter. Further work is ongoing to reduce this artifact.},

  abstract={Performance analysis of a commercial three-dimensional {(3-D)} dose mapping system based on optical {CT} scanning of polymer gels is presented. The system consists of {BANG} 3 polymer gels {(MGS} Research, Inc., Madison, {CT),} {OCTOPUS} laser {CT} scanner {(MGS} Research, Inc., Madison, {CT),} and an in-house developed software for optical {CT} image reconstruction and {3-D} dose distribution comparison between the gel, film measurements and the radiation therapy treatment plans. Various sources of image noise (digitization, electronic, optical, and mechanical) generated by the scanner as well as optical uniformity of the polymer gel are analyzed. The performance of the scanner is further evaluated in terms of the reproducibility of the data acquisition process, the uncertainties at different levels of reconstructed optical density per unit length and the effects of scanning parameters. It is demonstrated that for {BANG} 3 gel phantoms held in cylindrical plastic containers, the relative dose distribution can be reproduced by the scanner with an overall uncertainty of about 3\% within approximately 75\% of the radius of the container. In regions located closer to the container wall, however, the scanner generates erroneous optical density values that arise from the reflection and refraction of the laser rays at the interface between the gel and the container. The analysis of the accuracy of the polymer gel dosimeter is exemplified by the comparison of the {gel/OCT-derived} dose distributions with those from film measurements and a commercial treatment planning system {(Cadplan,} Varian Corporation, Palo Alto, {CA)} for a 6 cm x 6 cm single field of 6 {MV} x rays and a {3-D} conformal radiotherapy {(3DCRT)} plan. The gel measurements agree with the treatment plans and the film measurements within the {"}3\%-or-2 mm{"} criterion throughout the usable, artifact-free central region of the gel volume. Discrepancies among the three data sets are analyzed.},

  abstract={Optical computed tomography {(optical-CT)} of {3D} radiation dosimeters is a promising avenue for delivering an economic and reliable quality control of radiotherapy treatments such as intensity modulated radiotherapy, brachytherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery. The main problems in transferring {3D} dosimeters to clinical setting have been in (1) the complexity of manufacture and behaviour of {3D} dosimeters and (2) time-consuming readout and analysis of {3D} dosimeters. This paper addresses the readout problem by showing that fast (20 min tomography scan), precise (projection absorbance signal-to-noise ratio is greater than 100:1 across the absorbance range 0.2 to 1.5) and accurate (good linearity in the calibration curve) measurements are possible using a novel method of optically scanning a laser beam across the {3D} dosimeter.},

  abstract={In recent years, magnetic-resonance imaging of gelatin doped with the Fricke solution has been applied to the direct measurement of three-dimensional {(3D)} radiation dose distributions. However, the {3D} dose distribution can also be imaged more economically and efficiently using the method of optical absorption computed tomography. This is accomplished by first preparing a gelatin matrix containing a radiochromic dye and mapping the radiation-induced local change in the optical absorption coefficient. {Ferrous-Benzoic-Xylenol} {(FBX)} was the dye of choice for this investigation. The complex formed by Fe3+ and xylenol orange exhibits a linear change in optical attenuation (cm-1) with radiation dose in the range between 0 and 1000 {cGy,} and the local concentration of this complex can be probed using a green laser light (lambda = 543.5 nm). An optical computed tomography {(CT)} scanner was constructed analogous to a first-generation x-ray {CT} scanner, using a {He-Ne} laser, photodiodes, and rotation-translation stages controlled by a personal computer. The optical {CT} scanner itself can reconstruct attenuation coefficients to a baseline accuracy of \&lt; 2\% while yielding dose images accurate to within 5\% when other uncertainties are taken into account. Optical tomography is complicated by the reflection and refraction of light rays in the phantom materials, producing a blind spot in the transmission profiles which, results in a significant dose artifact in the reconstructed images. In this report we develop corrections used to reduce this artifact and yield accurate dosimetric maps. We also report the chemical reaction kinetics, the dose sensitivity and spatial resolution (\&lt; 1 mm3) obtained by optical absorption computed tomography. The article concludes with sample dose distributions produced by {"}cross-field{"} 6 {MV} x-ray beams, including a radiosurgery example.}

  abstract={We evaluated the {OCTOPUS-ONE} research laser {CT} scanner developed and manufactured by {MGS} Research, Inc. {(Madison,} {CT).} The scanner is designed for imaging {3D} optical density distributions in {BANG} gels. The scanner operates in a translate-rotate configuration with a single scanning laser beam. The rotating cylindrical gel phantom is immersed in a refractive index matching solution and positioned at the center of a square tank made of plastic and glass. A stationary polarized {He-Ne} laser beam (633 nm) is reflected from a mirror moving parallel to the tank wall and scans the gel. Another mirror moves synchronously along the opposite side of the tank and collects the transmitted light and sends it to a single stationary silicon photodetector. A filtered backprojection algorithm is used to reconstruct projection data in a plane. The laser-mirrors-detector assembly is mounted on a horizontal platform that moves vertically for slice selection. We have tested the mechanical and optical setup, projection centering on the axis of rotation, linearity, and spatial resolution. We found the optical detector to respond linearly to transmitted light from control samples. The spatial resolution of the scanner was determined by employing a split field resolution technique. We obtained the horizontal and vertical full widths at half maxima of the laser beam intensity profiles as 0.6 and 0.8 mm, respectively. Dose calibration tests of the gel were performed using a nine-field (2 x 2 cm2 each) dose pattern irradiated at different dose levels. Finally, we compared gel-derived {2D} planar dose distribution against radiochromic film measured dose distribution for both the nine-field and a uniform 5 x 5 cm2 field of 6 {MV} x rays. Very similar dose distributions were observed in gel and radiochromic film except in regions of steep dose gradient and highest dose. A dose normalization of 15.6\% was required between the two dosimeters due to differences in overall radiation response. After normalization, analysis using the gamma evaluation showed that the radiochromic film and gel-measured dose distributions differed by a maximum gamma of 1.3 using 5\% and 1.5 mm dose difference and distance-to-agreement criteria. The optical {CT} scanner has great potential as a {3D} dosimeter, but a few refinements and further testing are necessary before its routine clinical use.},

  abstract={The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the {"}tumor microenvironment.{"} Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

  abstract={This work presents extensive investigations to evaluate the robustness (intradosimeter consistency and temporal stability of response), reproducibility, precision, and accuracy of a relatively new {3D} dosimetry system comprising a leuco-dye doped plastic {3D} dosimeter {(PRESAGE)} and a commercial {optical-CT} scanner {(OCTOPUS} 5x scanner from {MGS} Research, Inc). Four identical {PRESAGE} {3D} dosimeters were created such that they were compatible with the Radiologic Physics Center {(RPC)} head-and-neck {(H\&amp;N)} {IMRT} credentialing phantom. Each dosimeter was irradiated with a rotationally symmetric arrangement of nine identical small fields (1 x 3 cm2) impinging on the flat circular face of the dosimeter. A repetitious sequence of three dose levels (4, 2.88, and 1.28 Gy) was delivered. The rotationally symmetric treatment resulted in a dose distribution with high spatial variation in axial planes but only gradual variation with depth along the long axis of the dosimeter. The significance of this treatment was that it facilitated accurate film dosimetry in the axial plane, for independent verification. Also, it enabled rigorous evaluation of robustness, reproducibility and accuracy of response, at the three dose levels. The {OCTOPUS} 5x commercial scanner was used for dose readout from the dosimeters at daily time intervals. The use of improved optics and acquisition technique yielded substantially improved noise characteristics (reduced to approximately 2\%) than has been achieved previously. Intradosimeter uniformity of radiochromic response was evaluated by calculating a {3D} gamma comparison between each dosimeter and axially rotated copies of the same dosimeter. This convenient technique exploits the rotational symmetry of the distribution. All points in the gamma comparison passed a 2\% difference, 1 mm distance-to-agreement criteria indicating excellent intradosimeter uniformity even at low dose levels. Postirradiation, the dosimeters were all found to exhibit a slight increase in opaqueness with time. However, the relative dose distribution was found to be extremely stable up to 90 h postirradiation indicating excellent temporal stability. Excellent interdosimeter reproducibility was also observed between the four dosimeters. Gamma comparison maps between each dosimeter and the average distribution of all four dosimeters showed full agreement at the 2\% difference, 2 mm distance-to-agreement level. Dose readout from the {3D} dosimetry system was found to agree better with independent film measurement than with treatment planning system calculations in penumbral regions and was generally accurate to within 2\% dose difference and 2 mm distance-to-agreement. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate excellent precision, accuracy, robustness, and reproducibility of the {PRESAGE/optical-CT} system for relative {3D} dosimetry and support its potential integration with the {RPC} {H\&amp;N} credentialing phantom for {IMRT} verification.},

  abstract={The performance of a fast optical computed tomography {(CT)} scanner based on a point laser source, a small area photodiode detector, and two optical-grade Fresnel lenses is evaluated. The {OCTOPUS\&\#x2122;-10\&\#xD7;\&\#xA0;optical} {CT} scanner {(MGS} Research Inc., Madison, {CT)} is an upgrade of the {OCTOPUS\&\#x2122;\&\#xA0;research} scanner with improved design for faster motion of the laser beam and faster data acquisition process. The motion of the laser beam in the new configuration is driven by the rotational motion of a scanning mirror. The center of the scanning mirror and the center of the photodiode detector are adjusted to be on the focal points of two coaxial Fresnel lenses. A glass water tank is placed between the two Fresnel lenses to house gel phantoms and matching liquids. The laser beam scans over the water tank in parallel beam geometry for projection data as the scanning mirror rotates at a frequency faster than {0.1\&\#xA0;s} per circle. Signal sampling is performed independently of the motion of the scanning mirror, to reduce the processing time for the synchronization of the stepper motors and the data acquisition board. An in-house developed reference image normalization mechanism is added to the image reconstruction program to correct the non-uniform light transmitting property of the Fresnel lenses. Technical issues with regard to the new design of the scanner are addressed, including projection data extraction from raw data samples, non-uniform pixel averaging and reference image normalization. To evaluate the dosimetric accuracy of the scanner, the reconstructed images from a 16 {MeV,} {6\&\#xA0;cm\&\#xA0;\&\#xD7;\&\#xA0;6\&\#xA0;cm} electron field irradiation were compared with those from the Eclipse treatment planning system {(Varian} Corporation, Palo Alto, {CA).} The spatial resolution of the scanner is demonstrated to be of sub-millimeter accuracy. The effectiveness of the reference normalization method for correcting the non-uniform light transmitting property of the Fresnel lenses is analyzed. A sub-millimeter accuracy of the phantom positioning between the reference scan and the actual scan is demonstrated to be essential. The fast scanner is shown to be able to scan gel phantoms with a wider field of view {(5\&\#xA0;mm} from the edge of the scanned dosimeters) and at a speed 10 to {20\&\#xA0;times} faster than the {OCTOPUS\&\#x2122;\&\#xA0;scanner.} A large uncertainty of 5\% (defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) is typically observed in the reconstructed images, owing to the inaccuracy in the phantom positioning process. Methods for further improvement of the accuracy of the in-house modified {OCTOPUS\&\#x2122;-10\&\#xD7;\&\#xA0;scanner} are discussed.},

For each time delay, the {3-D} time-gated intensity distribution is reconstructed using a filtered back projection algorithm and the fluorescence lifetime subsequently determined for each reconstructed horizontal plane by iterative fitting to a mono-exponential decay. Due to its inherently ratiometric nature, fluorescence lifetime is robust against intensity based artefacts as well as producing a quantitative measure of the fluorescence signal. We present a {3-D} fluorescence lifetime reconstruction of a mouse embryo labelled with an alexa-488 conjugated antibody targeted to the neurofilament, which clearly differentiates between the extrinsic label and the autofluorescence, particularly from the heart and dorsal aorta.},

  abstract={The accurate registration of multiview images is of central importance in many advanced image processing applications. Image super-resolution, for example, is a typical application where the quality of the super-resolved image is degrading as registration errors increase. Popular registration methods are often based on features extracted from the acquired images. The accuracy of the registration is in this case directly related to the number of extracted features and to the precision at which the features are located: images are best registered when many features are found with a good precision. However, in low-resolution images, only a few features can be extracted and often with a poor precision. By taking a sampling perspective, we propose in this paper new methods for extracting features in low-resolution images in order to develop efficient registration techniques. We consider, in particular, the sampling theory of signals with finite rate of innovation and show that some features of interest for registration can be retrieved perfectly in this framework, thus allowing an exact registration. We also demonstrate through simulations that the sampling model which enables the use of finite rate of innovation principles is well suited for modeling the acquisition of images by a camera. Simulations of image registration and image super-resolution of artificially sampled images are first presented, analyzed and compared to traditional techniques. We finally present favorable experimental results of super-resolution of real images acquired by a digital camera available on the market.},

  abstract={Optical {CT} scanners for a {3D} readout of externally irradiated radiosensitive hydrogels currently require the use of a refractive index {(RI)} matching liquid bath to obtain suitable optical ray paths through the gel sample to the detector. The requirement for a {RI} matching liquid bath has been negated by the design of a plastic cylindrical gel container that provides parallel beam geometry through the gel sample for the majority of the projection. The design method can be used for various hydrogels. Preliminary test results for the prototype laser beam scanner with ferrous xylenol-orange gel show geometric distortion of {0.2\&\#xA0;mm} maximum, spatial resolution limited to beam spot size of about {0.4\&\#xA0;mm} and 0.8\% noise (1 {SD)} for a uniform irradiation. Reconstruction of a star pattern irradiated through the cylinder walls demonstrates the suitability for external beam applications. The extremely simple and cost-effective construction of this optical {CT} scanner, together with the simplicity of scanning gel samples without {RI} matching fluid increases the feasibility of using {3D} gel dosimetry for clinical external beam dose verifications.},

  abstract={Since its advent during the mid-twentieth century, radiosurgery has undergone a steady evolution. Gamma Knife and linear accelerator based systems using rigid frames preceded the development of frameless devices. The present report describes the development of microbeam radiosurgery, a technique which uses submillimetric beams of radiation to treat disease. Typically, the technique is employed using parallel arrays of beams delivered via a high-fluence synchrotron source. Beam widths between 20 and 950 {\&\#x3BC;m} have been used with the majority of studies utilizing beam widths less than 100 {\&\#x3BC;m.} In addition to its high precision, the technique allows users to take advantage of two unique properties of microbeams. The first is a remarkable tolerance of healthy tissue to microbeams delivered at doses up to several hundred grays, while at the same time, tumors are highly susceptible to the lethal effects of microbeams. Together, these findings allow for a {"}preferential tumoricidal effect{"} beyond the typical dose-volume relationship. Although only used in animal experiments so far, we explore the hypothetical clinical role of microbeam radiosurgery which may be feasible in the near future. In addition to the treatment of traditional radiosurgery targets such as malignancies and vascular malformations, microbeams may allow the non-invasive treatment of functional disease such as movement disorders, epilepsy, and mental illness.},

For each configuration the efficacy of 3 refractive media were investigated: air, water, and a fluid closely matched to Presage {(RI} = 1.00, 1.33 and 1.49 respectively). The results revealed that the useable radius of the dosimeter (i.e. where data was within 2\% of truth) reduced to 68\% for water-matching, and 31\% for dry-scanning in air. Point source incident ray geometry produced slightly more favourable results, although variation between the three geometries was relatively small. The required detector size however, increased by a factor six for dry-scanning, introducing cost penalties. For applications where dose information is not required in the periphery, some dry and low-viscous matching configurations may be feasible.},

  abstract={Radiochromic plastic and gel materials have recently emerged which can yield {3D} dose information over clinical volumes in high resolution. These dosimeters can provide a much more comprehensive verification of complex radiation therapy treatments than can be achieved by conventional planar and point dosimeters. To achieve full clinical potential, these dosimeters require a fast and accurate read-out technology. Broad-beam optical-computed tomography {(optical-CT)} systems have shown promise, but can be sensitive to stray light artifacts originating in the imaging chain. In this work we present and evaluate a method to correct for stray light artifacts by deconvolving a measured, spatially invariant, point spread function {(PSF).} The correction was developed for the {DLOS} {(Duke} large field-of-view {optical-CT} scanner) in conjunction with radiochromic {PRESAGE\&\#xAE;} dosimeters. The {PSF} was constructed from a series of acquisitions of projection images of various sized apertures placed in the optical imaging chain. Images were acquired with a range of exposure times, and for a range of aperture sizes (0.2-11 mm). The {PSF} is investigated under a variety of conditions, and found to be robust and spatially invariant, key factors enabling the viability of the deconvolution approach. The spatial invariance and robustness of the {PSF} are facilitated by telecentric imaging, which produces a collimated light beam and removes stray light originating upstream of the imaging lens. The telecentric capability of the {DLOS} therefore represents a significant advantage, both in keeping stray light levels to a minimum and enabling viability of an accurate {PSF} deconvolution method to correct for the residual. The performance of the correction method was evaluated on projection images containing known optical-density variations, and also on known {3D} dose distributions. The method is shown to accurately account for stray light on small field dosimetry with corrections up to 3\% in magnitude shown here although corrections of \&gt;10\% have been observed in extreme cases. The dominant source of stray light was found to be within the imaging lens. Correcting for stray light extended the dynamic range of the system from {\&\#x223C;30} to {\&\#x223C;60} {dB.} The correction should be used when measurements need to be accurate within 3\%.},

This work describes a new application of magnetic resonance imaging to radiation dose planning. Agarose gels containing ferrous sulfate, sulfuric acid, and benzoic acid have been irradiated with {137Cs} gamma rays and 6-14 {MeV} electrons, to doses of up to 20 Gy. The dose distributions have been imaged by magnetic resonance, making use of the effect on the T1 proton relaxation times of the radiolytic Fe3+. The image intensity was proportional to doses of up to 10 Gy, and images were stable for at least 24 h postirradiation. The G value for Fe3+ production was about 100 (molecules per 100 {eV} absorbed).}

  abstract={A new type of tissue-equivalent medium for magnetic resonance imaging of the dose distributions produced by ionizing radiation has been developed. Agarose gel is infused with acrylamide and {N,N'-methylene-bis-acrylamide} {(Bis)} comonomers, which are readily polymerized by free radical initiators in de-aerated aqueous solutions. Polymerization and cross-linking induced locally by free radical products of water radiolysis increase the rate of water proton spin relaxation gradually up to doses of about 15 Gy. The slopes of the dose-response curves at 64 {MHz} are 0.015 and 0.28 s-1 Gy-1 for R1 and R2, respectively. The agarose matrix as well as the high (50\% by weight) relative concentration of the cross-linker {(Bis)} per total comonomer limit the spread of polymerization so that the spatial distribution of the radiation dose is faithfully represented in the resultant spatial distribution of relaxation rates. The gel can be imaged with conventional magnetic resonance imaging devices with high spatial resolution and accuracy. In addition, due to the well established effect of the precipitation of insoluble agglomerates of highly cross-linked acrylamide, the optical turbidity of the gel increases gradually with the absorbed dose. This may provide an additional means of visualizing the dose distribution in three dimensions. The major advantage of the {acrylamide-Bis-agarose} gels over those that depend on ionic chemical dosimeters, for example, Fricke-infused gels, lies in the lack of diffusion of radiation-induced chemical changes subsequent to or concurrent with irradiation.}

  abstract={Precise methods of modem radiation therapy such as intensity modulated radiotherapy {(IMRT),} brachytherapy {(BT)} and high {LET} irradiation allow for high dose localization in volumes of a few mm3. However, most dosimetry methods-ionization chambers, {TLD} arrangements or silicon detectors, for example-are not capable of detecting sub-mm dose variations or do not allow for simple dose imaging. Magnetic resonance based polymer dosimetry {(MRPD)} appears to be well suited to three-dimensional high resolution relative dosimetry but the spatial resolution based on a systematic modulation transfer function {(MTF)} approach has not yet been investigated. We offer a theoretical construct for addressing the spatial resolution in different dose imaging systems, i.e. the dose modulation transfer function {(DMTF)} approach, an experimental realization of this concept with a phantom and quantitative comparisons between two dosimetric systems: polymer gel and film dosimetry. Polymer gel samples were irradiated by Co-60 photons through an absorber grid which is characterized by periodic structures of different spatial period (a), the smallest one at width of a/2 = 280 microm. The modulation in dose under the grid is visualized via calibrated, high resolution, parameter-selective {(T2)} and dose images based on multi-echo {MR} imaging. The {DMTF} is obtained from the modulation depth of the spin-spin relaxation time {(T2)} after calibration. Voxel sizes below 0.04 mm3 could be achieved, which are significantly smaller than those reported in {MR} based dose imaging on polymer gels elsewhere, using a powerful gradient system and a highly sensitive small birdcage resonator on a whole-body {3T} {MR} scanner. Dose modulations at 22\% of maximum dose amplitude could be observed at about 2 line pairs per mm. The polymer {DMTF} results are compared to those of a typical clinical film-scanner system. This study demonstrates that {MR} based gel dosimetry at 200 microm pixel resolution might even be superior, with reference to relative spatial resolution, to the results of a standard film-scanner system offering a nominal scan resolution of 200 microm.}

  abstract={The verification of dose distributions with high dose gradients as appearing in brachytherapy or stereotactic radiotherapy for example, calls for dosimetric methods with sufficiently high spatial resolution. Polymer gels in combination with a {MR} or optical scanner as a readout device have the potential of performing the verification of a three-dimensional dose distribution within a single measurement. The purpose of this work is to investigate the spatial resolution achievable in {MR-based} polymer gel dosimetry. The authors show that dosimetry on a very small spatial scale (voxel size: 94 x 94 x 1000 microm3) can be performed with normoxic polymer gels using parameter selective T2 imaging. In order to prove the spatial resolution obtained we are relying on the dose-modulation transfer function {(DMTF)} concept based on very fine dose modulations at half periods of 200 microm. Very fine periodic dose modulations of a {60Co} photon field were achieved by means of an absorption grid made of tungsten-carbide, specifically designed for quality control. The dose modulation in the polymer gel is compared with that of film dosimetry in one plane via the {DMTF} concept for general access to the spatial resolution of a dose imaging system. Additionally Monte Carlo simulations were performed and used for the calculation of the {DMTF} of both, the polymer gel and film dosimetry. The results obtained by film dosimetry agree well with those of Monte Carlo simulations, whereas polymer gel dosimetry overestimates the amplitude value of the fine dose modulations. The authors discuss possible reasons. The in-plane resolution achieved in this work competes with the spatial resolution of standard clinical film-scanner systems.}

  abstract={For the past 50 years there has been interest in developing {3-D} dosemeters for ionising radiation. Particular emphasis has been put on those dosemeters that change their optical properties in proportion to the absorbed dose. Many of the dosemeters that have been evaluated have had limitations such as lack of transparency, diffusion of the image of the dose distribution or poor stability of baseline optical density. Many of these performance limitations have been overcome by the development of {PRESAGE,} an optically clear polyurethane-based radiochromic {3-D} dosemeter. The solid {PRESAGE} dosemeter is formulated with a free radical initiator and a leuco dye and it does not require a container to maintain its shape. The polyurethane matrix is tissue equivalent and prevents the diffusion of the dose distribution image. There is a linear dose-response, which is independent of both photon energy and dose rate. Simple precautions such as preventing long-term exposure to additional ionising radiation including ultraviolet and controlling storage temperatures prevent the bleaching of the radiochromic response field within the irradiated dosemeter.},

  abstract={Synchrotron-generated microbeam radiotherapy holds great promise for future treatment, but the high dose gradients present conventional dosimetry with a challenge. Measuring the important peak-to-valley dose ratio {(PVDR)} of a microbeam-collimated synchrotron source requires both a dosimeter and an analysis method capable of exceptional spatial resolution. The {PVDR} is of great interest since it is the limiting factor for potential application of the microbeam radiation therapy technique clinically for its tissue-sparing properties (i.e. the valley dose should be below the tolerance of normal tissue). In this work a new method of measuring the dose response of {PRESAGE} dosimeters is introduced using the fluorescence from a 638\&\#x2005;nm laser on a confocal laser-scanning microscope. This fluorescent microscopy method produces dosimetry data at a pixel size as low as 78\&\#x2005;nm, giving a much better spatial resolution than optical computed tomography, which is normally used for scanning {PRESAGE} dosimeters. Using this technique the {PVDR} of the {BL28B2} microbeam at the {SPring-8} synchrotron in Japan is estimated to be approximately 52:1 at a depth of 2.5\&\#x2005;mm. The {PVDR} was also estimated with {EBT2} {GAFchromic} films as 30.5:1 at the surface in order to compare the {PRESAGE} fluorescent results with a more established dosimetry system. This estimation is in good agreement with previously measured ratios using other dosimeters and Monte Carlo simulations. This means that it is possible to use {PRESAGE} dosimeters with confocal microscopy for the determination of {PVDR.}},

  abstract={Microbeam Radiation Therapy {(MRT)} is a preclinical form of radiosurgery dedicated to brain tumor treatment. It uses micrometer-wide synchrotron-generated X-ray beams on the basis of spatial beam fractionation. Due to the radioresistance of normal brain vasculature to {MRT,} a continuous blood supply can be maintained which would in part explain the surprising tolerance of normal tissues to very high radiation doses (hundreds of Gy). Based on this well described normal tissue sparing effect of microplanar beams, we developed a new irradiation geometry which allows the delivery of a high uniform dose deposition at a given brain target whereas surrounding normal tissues are irradiated by well tolerated parallel microbeams only. Normal rat brains were exposed to 4 focally interlaced arrays of 10 microplanar beams (52 microm wide, spaced 200 microm on-center, 50 to 350 {keV} in energy range), targeted from 4 different ports, with a peak entrance dose of {200Gy} each, to deliver an homogenous dose to a target volume of 7 mm(3) in the caudate nucleus. Magnetic resonance imaging follow-up of rats showed a highly localized increase in blood vessel permeability, starting 1 week after irradiation. Contrast agent diffusion was confined to the target volume and was still observed 1 month after irradiation, along with histopathological changes, including damaged blood vessels. No changes in vessel permeability were detected in the normal brain tissue surrounding the target. The interlacing radiation-induced reduction of spontaneous seizures of epileptic rats illustrated the potential pre-clinical applications of this new irradiation geometry. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations performed on a human-sized head phantom suggested that synchrotron photons can be used for human radiosurgical applications. Our data show that interlaced microbeam irradiation allows a high homogeneous dose deposition in a brain target and leads to a confined tissue necrosis while sparing surrounding tissues. The use of synchrotron-generated X-rays enables delivery of high doses for destruction of small focal regions in human brains, with sharper dose fall-offs than those described in any other conventional radiation therapy.},

  abstract={A reliable understanding of radiolysis processes in supercritical water {(SCW)-cooled} reactors is crucial to developing chemistry control strategies that minimize the corrosion and degradation of materials. However, directly measuring the chemistry in reactor cores is difficult due to the extreme conditions of high temperature and pressure and mixed neutron and gamma-radiation fields, which are incompatible with normal chemical instrumentation. Thus, chemical models and computer simulations are an important route of investigation for predicting the detailed radiation chemistry of the coolant in a {SCW} reactor and the consequences for materials. Surprisingly, information on the fast neutron radiolysis of water at high temperatures is limited, and even more so for fast neutron irradiation of {SCW.} In this work, Monte Carlo simulations were used to predict the G values for the primary species e(-)aq, H(\&\#x2022;), H2, {(\&\#x2022;)OH} and {H2O2} formed from the radiolysis of pure, deaerated {SCW} {(H2O)} by 2 {MeV} monoenergetic neutrons at {400\&\#xB0;C} as a function of water density in the range of {\&\#x223C;0.15-0.6} g/cm(3). The 2 {MeV} neutron was taken as representative of a fast neutron flux in a reactor. For light water, the moderation of these neutrons after knock-on collisions with water molecules generated mostly recoil protons of 1.264, 0.465, 0.171 and 0.063 {MeV.} Neglecting oxygen ion recoils and assuming that the most significant contribution to the radiolysis came from these first four recoil protons, the fast neutron yields were estimated as the sum of the G values for these protons after appropriate weightings were applied according to their energy. Calculated yields were compared with available experimental data and with data obtained for {low-LET} radiation. Most interestingly, the reaction of H(\&\#x2022;) atoms with water was found to play a critical role in the formation yields of H2 and {(\&\#x2022;)OH} at {400\&\#xB0;C.} Recent work has underscored the potential importance of this reaction above {200\&\#xB0;C,} but its rate constant is still controversial.},

  abstract={The commissioning of a three-dimensional treatment planning system requires comparisons of measured and calculated dose distributions. Techniques have been developed to facilitate quantitative comparisons, including superimposed isodoses, dose-difference, and distance-to-agreement {(DTA)} distributions. The criterion for acceptable calculation performance is generally defined as a tolerance of the dose and {DTA} in regions of low and high dose gradients, respectively. The dose difference and {DTA} distributions complement each other in their useful regions. A composite distribution has recently been developed that presents the dose difference in regions that fail both dose-difference and {DTA} comparison criteria. Although the composite distribution identifies locations where the calculation fails the preselected criteria, no numerical quality measure is provided for display or analysis. A technique is developed to unify dose distribution comparisons using the acceptance criteria. The measure of acceptability is the multidimensional distance between the measurement and calculation points in both the dose and the physical distance, scaled as a fraction of the acceptance criteria. In a space composed of dose and spatial coordinates, the acceptance criteria form an ellipsoid surface, the major axis scales of which are determined by individual acceptance criteria and the center of which is located at the measurement point in question. When the calculated dose distribution surface passes through the ellipsoid, the calculation passes the acceptance test for the measurement point. The minimum radial distance between the measurement point and the calculation points (expressed as a surface in the dose-distance space) is termed the gamma index. Regions where gamma {\textgreater} 1 correspond to locations where the calculation does not meet the acceptance criteria. The determination of gamma throughout the measured dose distribution provides a presentation that quantitatively indicates the calculation accuracy. Examples of a 6 {MV} beam penumbra are used to illustrate the gamma index.},

  abstract={Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality in the Western world. It is well established that the spread of breast cancer, first locally and later distally, is a major factor in patient prognosis. Experimental systems of breast cancer rely on cell lines usually derived from primary tumours or pleural effusions. Two major obstacles hinder this research: (i) some known sub-types of breast cancers (notably poor prognosis luminal B tumours) are not represented within current line collections; (ii) the influence of the tumour microenvironment is not usually taken into account. We demonstrate a technique to culture primary breast cancer specimens of all sub-types. This is achieved by using three-dimensional {(3D)} culture system in which small pieces of tumour are embedded in soft rat collagen I cushions. Within 2-3 weeks, the tumour cells spread into the collagen and form various structures similar to those observed in human tumours1. Viable adipocytes, epithelial cells and fibroblasts within the original core were evident on histology. Malignant epithelial cells with squamoid morphology were demonstrated invading into the surrounding collagen. Nuclear pleomorphism was evident within these cells, along with mitotic figures and apoptotic bodies. We have employed Optical Projection Tomography {(OPT),} a {3D} imaging technology, in order to quantify the extent of tumour spread in culture.  We have used {OPT} to measure the bulk volume of the tumour culture, a parameter routinely measured during the neo-adjuvant treatment of breast cancer patients to assess response to drug therapy. Here, we present an opportunity to culture human breast tumours without sub-type bias and quantify the spread of those ex vivo. This method could be used in the future to quantify drug sensitivity in original tumour.  This may provide a more predictive model than currently used cell lines.},

We present an approach to digital staining of histopathology multispectral images by combining the effects of spectral enhancement and spectral transformation. Spectral enhancement is accomplished by shifting the N-band original spectrum of the multispectral pixel with the weighted difference between the pixel’s original and estimated spectrum; the spectrum is estimated using {M~{\textless}~N} principal component {(PC)} vectors. The pixel’s enhanced spectrum is transformed to the spectral configuration associated to its reaction to a specific stain by utilizing an {N~{\texttimes}~N} transformation matrix, which is derived through application of least mean squares method to the enhanced and target spectral transmittance samples of the different tissue components found in the image. Results of our experiments on the digital conversion of an {H\&E} stained multispectral image to its Masson’s trichrome stained equivalent show the viability of the method.},

In the absence of Fgf10 expression, the spleno-pancreatic mesenchyme and surrounding {SMP} grow laterally but contain no endodermal component, showing that leftward growth is autonomous and independent of endoderm. In the Bapx1(-/-) mutants, the {SMP} is defective. Normally, the {SMP} is a source for both Fgf9 and Fgf10; however, in the Bapx1 mutant, Fgf10 expression is downregulated and the dorsal pancreas remains at the midline. We conclude that the {SMP} is an organiser responsible for the leftward growth of the spleno-pancreatic region and that Bapx1 regulates {SMP} functions required for pancreatic laterality.},

The role of Mb-facilitated diffusion was examined in Mb {KO} mice. Distribution of {GLUT4} was also evaluated in the context of the capillary and mitochondrial network. {MPM} revealed that 43.6~{\textpm}~3.3\% of oxidative fiber capillaries had ≥50\% of their circumference embedded in a groove in the sarcolemma, in vivo. Embedded capillaries were tightly associated with dense mitochondrial populations lateral to capillary grooves and nearly absent below the groove. Mitochondrial distribution, number of embedded capillaries, and capillary-to-fiber contact were proportional to fiber oxidative capacity and unaffected by Mb {KO.} {GLUT4} did not preferentially localize to embedded capillaries. Embedding capillaries in the sarcolemma may provide a regulatory mechanism to optimize delivery of oxygen to heterogeneous groups of muscle fibers. We hypothesize that mitochondria locate to {PV} regions due to myofibril voids created by embedded capillaries, not to enhance the delivery of oxygen to the mitochondria.},

We used optical micro-angiography {(OMAG)} to study endogenous revascularization in living mice following brain injury. {OMAG} is a volumetric optical imaging method capable of in vivo mapping of localized blood perfusion within the scanned tissue beds down to capillary level imaging resolution. We demonstrated that {OMAG} can differentiate revascularization progression between traumatized mice with and without soluble epoxide hydrolase {(sEH)} gene deletion. The time course of revascularization was determined from serial imaging of the traumatic region in the same mice over a one-month period of rehabilitation. Restoration of blood volume at the lesion site was more pronounced in {sEH} knockout mice than in wild-type mice as determined by {OMAG.} These {OMAG} measurements were confirmed by histology and showed that the {sEH} knockout effect may be involved in enhancing revascularization. The correlation of {OMAG} with histology also suggests that {OMAG} is a useful imaging tool for real-time in vivo monitoring of post-traumatic revascularization and for evaluating agents that inhibit or promote endogenous revascularization during the recovery process in small rodents.},

  abstract={Intestinal microvasculature plays a central role in nutrient absorption and immune response against infections. Microscopic visualization of intestinal microvasculature under normal and pathological conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease is essential for understanding the pathophysiology of the disease. Despite the intensive need to characterize the intestinal microstructure and vasculature in an integrated fashion, 3-dimensional {(3D)} visualization of the gastrointestinal tissue is often limited by the spatial resolution of the imaging tools. In this research, we aimed to apply optical clearing to minimize the random light scattering in the mouse ileum, thereby facilitating photon penetration for high-resolution, {3D} optical microscopy of the tissue network without microtome sectioning. We applied cardiac perfusion of lipophilic dialkylcarbocyanine dye {DiD} (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate) to label the mouse blood vessels, including the intestinal microvasculature. The labeled and paraformaldehyde-fixed ileum was immersed in the aqueous optical-clearing solution to improve photon penetration. Optical clearing revealed the interior domain of the mouse ileal mucosa and submucosa, where random light scattering was suppressed and the size of the microstructure in the fixed specimen remained the same. Using fluorescent labeling, the intestinal microstructure and vasculature were simultaneously imaged by {3D} confocal microscopy to allow for an integrated visualization of the tissue network with high definition. This new optical approach provides a useful tool for {3D} presentation and analysis of the microvasculature for better understanding the intestinal physiology.},

Appropriate pre-clinical evaluation of Rv in animal tumour models will improve the interpretation and guide the introduction of the biomarker into clinical studies. The objective of this study was to compare Rv measured in vivo with vessel size measurements from high-resolution X-ray computed tomography {(μCT)} of vascular corrosion casts measured post mortem from the same tumours, with and without vascular targeted therapy. {MRI} measurements were first acquired from subcutaneous {SW1222} colorectal xenografts in mice following treatment with 0 (n~=~6), 30 (n~=~6) or 200~mg/kg (n~=~3) of the vascular disrupting agent {ZD6126.} The mice were then immediately infused with a low viscosity resin and, following polymerisation and maceration of surrounding tissues, the resulting tumour vascular casts were dissected and subsequently imaged using an optimised {μCT} imaging approach. Vessel diameters were not measurable by {μCT} in the 200~mg/kg group as the high dose of {ZD6126} precluded delivery of the resin to the tumour vascular bed. The mean Rv for the three treatment groups was 24, 23 and 23.5~μm respectively; the corresponding {μCT} measurements from corrosion casts from the 0 and 30~mg/kg cohorts were 25 and 28~μm. The strong association between the in vivo {MRI} and post mortem {μCT} values supports the use of Rv as an imaging biomarker in clinical trials of investigational vascular targeted therapies.},

  abstract={Optical coherence tomography {(OCT)} based microangiography is capable of visualizing {3D} functional blood vessel networks within microcirculatory tissue beds in vivo. To provide the quantitative information of vasculature from the microangiograms such as vessel diameter and morphology, it is necessary to develop efficient vessel segmentation algorithms. In this paper, we propose to develop a hybrid Hessian/intensity based method to segment and quantify shape and diameter of the blood vessels innervating capillary beds that are imaged by functional {OCT} in vivo. The proposed method utilizes multi-scale Hessian filters to segment tubular structures such as blood vessels, but compounded by the intensity-based segmentation method to mitigate the limitations of Hessian filters' sensitivity to the selection of scale parameters. Such compounding segmentation scheme takes advantage of the morphological nature of Hessian filters while correcting for the scale parameter selection by intensity-based segmentation. The proposed algorithm is tested on a wound healing model and its performance of segmentation vessels is quantified by a publicly available manual segmentation dataset. We believe that this method will play an important role in the quantification of micro-angiograms for microcirculation research in ophthalmology and diagnosing retinal eye diseases involved with microcirculation.},

Blood-borne Ags are trapped mainly in the splenic marginal zone. To identify the cell populations responsible for Ag trapping in the marginal zone, mice were selectively depleted of marginal zone macrophages and marginal metallophilic macrophages. In the absence of these cells, trapping of microspheres and Listeria monocytogenes organisms was lost, and early control of infection was impaired. Depletion of marginal zone macrophages and marginal metallophilic macrophages, however, did not limit Ag presentation because Listeria-specific protective T cell immunity was induced. Therefore, marginal zone macrophages and marginal metallophilic macrophages are crucial for trapping of particulate Ag but dispensable for Ag presentation.}

Using slow motion replay, we measured the widths of endothelial cells {(C),} pericytes {(P,} when present) and capillary lumens {(L;} at the site of constriction; U; 15-20 micron upstream), throughout 11-12 min sequences containing many contraction/relaxation cycles. In roughly 50\% of contractions L decreased to 0-1 micron, such luminal {"}closures{"} occurring within 2-12 sec and lasting for less than 1 sec to greater than 1 min. Intervals between contractions ranged from 12 sec to 3 min (average 1 min). Documentation of one such cycle by sequential photographs from the video monitor is presented, showing dramatic bulging of an endothelial cell into the lumen. Comparison of records of L and C versus time showed that almost invariably when L decreased C increased, and vice versa; highly significant correlations existed between C and L in every case {(P} less than 0.0005). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that changes in C were responsible for 18-77\% of the total variance in L, whereas P contributed only 0-4\%; changes in U, covariance between C, P, and U, and unexplained variance were responsible for 0-20, 11-30, and 11-53\%, respectively, of the total variance in L. We conclude that these spontaneous capillary contractions were primarily due to endothelial contractility.}

  abstract={In Optical Projection Tomography {(OPT),} if the rotational center deviates from the central line of the image and this offset is not corrected during the reconstruction, serious blurring will happen in the final 3-dimensional {(3D)} result. Therefore, the high-precision rotational center location method is very important for {OPT.} However, existing methods are inconvenient because they need active participation during the location process. Thus, the automated and fast rotational center location method is in great demand. In preliminary work, we proposed an automated rotational center location method which consisted of a high Specimen Signal Intensity {(SSI)} sinogram selection and a coarse-fine search. Our method had an accuracy of about 1/4 pixel. However, further robustness analysis of our method is lacking. In this paper, we have investigated its location errors on sinograms with various {SSIs} and analyzed whether it was effective to use high {SSI} sinograms for rotational center location. Moreover, we have also discussed the relationship between location errors and the starting rotational angles. The experimental results showed that our coarse-fine method was robust under different starting angles. Meanwhile, the high {SSI} sinogram selection scheme improved the location precision.},

  abstract={Branching morphogenesis is a central process in renal development, but imaging and quantifying this process beyond early organogenesis presents challenges due to growth of the kidney preventing ready imaging of the complex structures. Current analysis of renal development relies heavily on explant organ culture and visualization by confocal microscopy, as a more developmentally advanced native tissue is too thick for conventional microscopic imaging. Cultured renal primordia lack vascularization and a supportive matrix for normal growth, resulting in tissue compression and distortion of ureteric branching. To overcome this, we used optical projection tomography to image and reconstruct the branching ureter epithelium of ex vivo embryonic kidneys and developed software to quantify these three-dimensional {(3D)} data. Ureteric branching was assessed by measuring tree and terminal branch length, tip number, branching iterations, branch angles, and inter-tip distances in {3D} space. To validate this approach for analyzing genetic influences on renal development, we assessed branching and organ morphology in Tgfβ2+/− embryos from E12.5 through E15.5. We found decreased branching, contrary to previous findings using organ culture, and quantified a primary defect in renal pelvic formation. Our approach offers many advantages from improved throughput, analysis, and observation of in vivo branching states, and has demonstrated its utility in studying the basis of renal developmental disease.},

  abstract={Developmental branching morphogenesis establishes organ architecture, and it is driven by iterative interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal progenitor cell populations. We describe an approach for analyzing this interaction and how it contributes to organ development. After initial in vivo cell labeling with the nucleoside analog ​5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine {(​EdU)} and tissue-specific antibodies, optical projection tomography {(OPT)} and confocal microscopy are used to image the developing organ. These imaging data then inform a second analysis phase that quantifies (using Imaris and Tree Surveyor software), models and integrates these events at a cell and tissue level in {3D} space and across developmental time. The protocol establishes a benchmark for assessing the impact of genetic change or fetal environment on organogenesis that does not rely on ex vivo organ culture or section-based reconstruction. By using this approach, examination of two developmental stages for an organ such as the kidney can be undertaken by a postdoctoral-level researcher in 6 weeks, with a full developmental analysis in mouse achievable in 5 months.},

Because high levels of {MYCN} are associated with enhanced tumor angiogenesis and poor clinical outcome in neuroblastoma, we serially characterized malignant progression, angiogenesis, and sensitivity to angiogenic blockade in tumors from these animals. Tumor cells were proliferative, secreted high levels of the angiogenic ligand vascular endothelial growth factor {(VEGF),} and recruited a complex vasculature expressing the angiogenic markers {VEGF-R2,} {α-SMA,} and matrix metalloproteinases {MMP-2} and {MMP-9,} all of which are also expressed in human disease. Treatment of established murine tumors with the angiogenesis inhibitor {TNP-470} caused near-complete ablation, with reduced proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and vasculature disruption. Because {TNP-470} has been associated with neurotoxicity, we tested the recently described water-soluble {HPMA} {copolymer–TNP-470} conjugate (caplostatin), which showed comparable efficacy and was well tolerated without weight loss or neurotoxicity as measured by rotarod testing. This study highlights the importance of angiogenesis inhibition in a spontaneous murine tumor with native tumor–microenvironment interactions, validates the use of mice transgenic for {TH-MYCN} as a model for therapy in this common pediatric tumor, and supports further clinical development of caplostatin as an antiangiogenic therapy in childhood neuroblastoma. {[Cancer} Res 2007;67(19):9435–42]},

It has routines for creating complex apertures and obscurations, wavefront errors (defined by Zernikes, power spectra, or user-supplied maps), amplitude modulators (e.g. coronagraphic occulters), simple lenses, and deformable mirrors. The routines automatically select which propagator (near or far-field) is best at each surface based on analytically propagating a Gaussian pilot beam.

While both methods can provide spatial resolution at the micrometer scale, {OPT} can provide superior imaging depth compared to {OCT.} However, {OPT} requires samples to be fixed, placed in an immobilization media such as agar, and cleared before imaging. Because {OCT} does not require fixing, it can be used to image embryos in vivo and in utero. In this study, we compare the efficacy of {OPT} and {OCT} for imaging murine embryonic development. The data demonstrate the superior capability of {OPT} for imaging fine structures with high resolution in optically-cleared embryos while only {OCT} can provide structural and functional imaging of live embryos ex vivo and in utero with micrometer scale resolution. {\textcopyright} (2015) {COPYRIGHT} Society of {Photo-Optical} Instrumentation Engineers {(SPIE).} Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.},

  year={2015},
  abstract={Micro-optical computed tomography {(MOCT)} is a method for performing image reconstruction using microscopic images to obtain tomographic images of small samples. Compared with conventional observation methods, it offers the possibility to obtain tomograpic images without distortion, and create three-dimensional images. However, {MOCT} system which developed previously outputs monochrome images, while useful color information could not be obtained from the analysis of the sample. Therefore, we focused on the features that simplify the wavelength measurement of visible light, and developed a color {MOCT} system that can obtain color tomographic images. In this study, we acquired tomographic images of phantom and biological samples, and evaluated its usefulness. In this system, a digital single-lens reflex camera was used as a detector that was connected to a stereoscopic microscope, and projection images were obtained by rotating the sample. The sample was fixed in the test tube by carrageenan. The projection images were obtained from various projection angles followed by decomposing the R, G and B components. Subsequently, we performed image reconstruction for each component using filtered back projection. Finally, color tomographic image was obtained by combining the three-color component images. In the experiments, we scanned a color phantom and biological samples and evaluated the color and shape reproducibility. As a result, it was found that the color and shape of the tomographic images were similar to those of the samples. These results indicate that the proposed system may be useful to obtain the three-dimensional color structure of biological samples. {\textcopyright} (2015) {COPYRIGHT} Society of {Photo-Optical} Instrumentation Engineers {(SPIE).} Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.},

  abstract={Generally, chemical tissue clearing is performed by a solution consisting of two parts benzyl benzoate and one part benzyl alcohol. However, prolonged exposure to this mixture markedly reduces the fluorescence of {GFP} expressing specimens, so that one has to compromise between clearing quality and fluorescence preservation. This can be a severe drawback when working with specimens exhibiting low {GFP} expression rates. Thus, we screened for a substitute and found that dibenzyl ether (phenylmethoxymethylbenzene, {CAS} 103-50-4) can be applied as a more {GFP-friendly} clearing medium. Clearing with dibenzyl ether provides improved tissue transparency and strikingly improved fluorescence intensity in {GFP} expressing mouse brains and other samples as mouse spinal cords, or embryos. Chemical clearing, staining, and embedding of biological samples mostly requires careful foregoing tissue dehydration. The commonly applied tissue dehydration medium is ethanol, which also can markedly impair {GFP} fluorescence. Screening for a substitute also for ethanol we found that tetrahydrofuran {(CAS} 109-99-9) is a more {GFP-friendly} dehydration medium than ethanol, providing better tissue transparency obtained by successive clearing. Combined, tetrahydrofuran and dibenzyl ether allow dehydration and chemical clearing of even delicate samples for {UM,} confocal microscopy, and other microscopy techniques.},

  author={M Prato and R Cavicchioli and L Zanni and P Boccacci and M Bertero},
  journal={{arXiv}},
  year={2012},
  abstract={The {Richardson-Lucy} method is the most popular deconvolution method in astronomy because it preserves the number of counts and the non-negativity of the original object. Regularization is, in general, obtained by an early stopping of {Richardson-Lucy} iterations. In the case of point-wise objects such as binaries or open star clusters, iterations can be pushed to convergence. However, it is well-known that {Richardson-Lucy} is an inefficient method. In most cases, acceptable solutions are obtained at the cost of hundreds or thousands of iterations. A general optimization method, referred to as the scaled gradient projection method, has been proposed for the constrained minimization of continuously differentiable convex functions. It is applicable to the non-negative minimization of the {Kullback-Leibler} divergence. If the scaling suggested by {Richardson-Lucy} is used in this method, then it provides a considerable increase in the efficiency of {Richardson-Lucy.} Therefore the aim of this paper is to apply the scaled gradient projection method to a number of imaging problems in astronomy such as single image deconvolution, multiple image deconvolution, and boundary effect correction. The corresponding algorithms are derived and implemented in interactive data language. To attempt to achieve a further increase in efficiency, we also consider an implementation on graphic processing units. The proposed algorithms are tested on simulated images. The acceleration of scaled gradient projection methods achieved with respect to the corresponding {Richardson-Lucy} methods strongly depends on both the problem and the specific object to be reconstructed, and in our simulations the improvement achieved ranges from about a factor of 4 to more than 30. Moreover, significant accelerations of up to two orders of magnitude have been observed between the serial and parallel implementations of the algorithms.},

  abstract={{ObjectivesMost} practitioners believe that use of two hearing aids is the ideal fitting for adults with bilateral symmetrical hearing loss. However, previous research has consistently shown that a substantial proportion of these patients actually prefer to use only one hearing aid. The current study explored whether this pattern of preferences is seen with technologically advanced hearing aids. In addition, a selection of variables that were available pre-fitting were used to attempt to predict which patients will prefer one hearing aid rather than {two.DesignThe} study was designed as a 12-week field trial including structured and unstructured use of one and two hearing aids. Ninety-four subjects with mild to moderate bilaterally symmetrical hearing loss were bilaterally fit with 2005-2007 era hearing aids. Potential predictors included demographic, audiometric, auditory lifestyle, personality, and binaural processing variables. After the field trial, each subject stated his/her preference for one or two hearing aids and completed three self-report outcome questionnaires for their preferred {fitting.ResultsPrevious} research was confirmed with modern technology hearing aids: after the field trial 46\% of the subjects preferred to use one hearing aid rather than two. Subjects who preferred two hearing aids tended to report better real-world outcomes than those who preferred one. Subjects who reported more hearing problems in daily life, who experienced more binaural loudness summation, and whose ears were more equivalent in dichotic listening were more likely to prefer to use two hearing aids. Contrary to conventional wisdom (ideas that are generally accepted as true), audiometric hearing loss and auditory lifestyle were not predictive of aiding preference. However, the best predictive approach from these data yielded accurate predictions for only two-thirds of {subjects.ConclusionsEvidence-based} practice calls for a conscientious melding of current evidence, clinical judgment, and patient preferences. The results of this research challenge practitioners to recognize that many patients who appear to be ideal candidates for bilateral aiding will actually prefer to wear only one hearing aid. Further, at this time there is not an accurate method that will predict which patients will prefer one hearing aid rather than two. Currently, the most effective approach open to practitioners would be to conduct a candid unbiased systematic field trial allowing each patient to compare unilateral and bilateral fittings in daily life. This might necessitate more fitting sessions and could perhaps add to the practitioner's burden. This downside should be weighed against the additional patient satisfaction that can be anticipated as a result of transparency in the fitting protocol, collaboration with the patient in the treatment decisions, and the knowledge of selecting the most cost-effective patient-centered solution.},

Thus animal models are necessary to study the {OSA} metastatic spread and to validate novel therapies able to control the systemic disease. We report the development of a syngeneic {(Balb/c)} murine {OSA} model, using a cell line derived from a spontaneous murine tumor. The tumorigenic and metastatic ability of {OSA} cell lines were assayed after orthotopic injection in mice distal femur. Expression profiling was carried out to characterize the parental and metastatic cell lines. Cells from metastases were propagated and engineered to express Luciferase, in order to follow metastases in vivo. Luciferase bioluminescence allowed to monitor the primary tumor growth and revealed the appearance of spontaneous pulmonary metastases. In vivo assays showed that metastasis is a stable property of metastatic {OSA} cell lines after both propagation in culture and luciferase trasduction. When compared to parental cell line, both unmodified and genetically marked metastatic cells, showed comparable and stable differential expression of the enpp4, pfn2 and prkcd genes, already associated to the metastatic phenotype in human cancer. This {OSA} animal model faithfully recapitulates some of the most important features of the human malignancy, such as lung metastatization. Moreover, the non-invasive imaging allows monitoring the tumor progression in living mice. A great asset of this model is the metastatic phenotype, which is a stable property, not modifiable after genetic manipulation.},

  abstract={The in vivo applications of gas-core microbubbles have been limited by gas diffusion, rapid body clearance, and poor vascular permeability. To overcome these limitations, using a modified three-step emulsion process, we have developed a first-of-its-kind India ink incorporated optically-triggerable phase-transition perfluorocarbon nanodroplets {(INDs)} that can provide not only three types of contrast mechanisms—conventional/thermoelastic photoacoustic, phase-transition/nonlinear photoacoustic, and ultrasound imaging contrasts, but also a new avenue for photoacoustic effect mediated tumor therapy. Upon pulsed laser illumination above a relatively low energy threshold, liquid-gas phase transition of the {INDs} has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, offering excellent contrasts for photoacoustic and ultrasound dual-modality imaging. With further increased laser energy, the nanodroplets have been shown to be capable of destructing cancer cells in vivo, presumably due to the photoacoustic effect induced shock-wave generation from the carbon particles of the incorporated India ink. The demonstrated results suggest that the developed multifunctional phase-transition nanodroplets have a great potential for many theranostic biomedical applications, including photoacoustic/ultrasound dual-modality molecular imaging and targeted, localized cancer therapy.},

  abstract={Immunohistochemistry {(IHC)} is used extensively to assess markers for prognosis and sensitivity to novel anticancer agents, as well as in the routine clinical assessment of cancers. Yet, although it is well known that tumors are highly heterogeneous, the resulting sampling error in the measurement of histological markers is often ignored, particularly in basic scientific studies. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that the optimization of tissue sampling to compensate for heterogeneity improves the correlation between histological measurements of the intrinsic hypoxia marker carbonic anhydrase {IX} {(CAIX)} and global tumor oxygenation status. The study was based on a group of 24 patients with invasive cervical carcinoma from whom multiple biopsies were obtained at the time of direct {pO2} assessment within the tumor, done as part of a research study. Measurements were made by image analysis of multiple deep sections cut through these biopsies, labeled for {CAIX} using both immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical techniques, and included tissue microarray {(TMA)} simulations. Variance and correlation analysis showed that the size of the tissue sample (biopsy or {TMA} core) was the major factor affecting accuracy of measurement in the sample. Sampling of multiple biopsies/cores also improved the global tumor assessment, provided that these were sufficiently separated in space. Optimization of sampling resulted in an improved correlation of {CAIX} staining with tumor {pO2} measurements, consistent with the hypothesis. However, {CAIX} was inferior to {pO2} measurements as a tool for patient stratification. Improved analytical methods to account for intratumoral heterogeneity are needed to provide reliable measurements of molecular markers.},

  abstract={Sampling error is an inherent problem of prostate biopsy. Consequently, there are problems in determining whether a given carcinoma is clinically significant on the basis of biopsy results. This study assesses the factors that predispose to errors in biopsy grading, as well as the dimensions of sampling error due to these factors. Among 187 cases, biopsy grading error was retrospectively related to grade heterogeneity in the prostate and to biopsy-related factors. Clinically relevant biopsy grading errors occurred in a quarter of the cases. Of all grading errors, at least 17\% resulted from misinterpretation by the pathologist only. Overall, prostates with grade heterogeneity revealed grading errors twice as frequently as specimens without grade heterogeneity. In most cases, however, grading error resulted from multiple factors, such as the number and length of cores obtained (p{\textless}0.05). This was an important finding because the mean core length was only 9.4 mm, whereas the biopsy needle is designed to obtain cores of 15 mm. Moreover, clinically relevant biopsy grading error had occurred in almost half of the cases when the Gleason score was based on a tumour deposit measvring less than 0.5 mm (p{\textless}0.05). The clinical consequences of these findings are important. Clinicians should try to obtain at least six biopsies, each 15 mm in length, to minimize grading error. Pathologists should be cautious in reporting Gleason scores based on tumour lesions smaller than 400x total magnification field. Interpretation could be refined, when necessary, by warning the urologist of the Limitations of the biopsy report. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract={As the largest single lymphatic organ in the human body, the spleen is responsible for central immunological and haematological tasks. Therefore, the spleen can be subject to a wide range of pathologic disorders. Computed tomography {(CT)} represents the most widely applied cross-sectional abdominal imaging technique and is considered the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of numerous abdominal pathological conditions. Hypodense splenic lesions are frequently encountered on abdominal {CT} images. Although most hypodense lesions of the spleen can be considered benign, some findings and clinical conditions warrant closer attention to the lesion. {CT} offers a number of morphological criteria that can be applied to differentiate hypodense lesions of the spleen, such as a the appearance of a lesion's borders, its attenuation, as well as the presence of calcifications or solid components.},

  abstract={Advances in hardware and software have enabled the realization of clinically feasible, quantitative multimodality imaging of tissue pathophysiology. Earlier efforts relating to multimodality imaging of cancer have focused on the integration of anatomical and functional characteristics, such as {PET–CT} and single-photon emission {CT} {(SPECT–CT),} whereas more-recent advances and applications have involved the integration of multiple quantitative, functional measurements (for example, multiple {PET} tracers, varied {MRI} contrast mechanisms, and {PET–MRI),} thereby providing a more-comprehensive characterization of the tumour phenotype. The enormous amount of complementary quantitative data generated by such studies is beginning to offer unique insights into opportunities to optimize care for individual patients. Although important technical optimization and improved biological interpretation of multimodality imaging findings are needed, this approach can already be applied informatively in clinical trials of cancer therapeutics using existing tools. These concepts are discussed herein.},

A comparison between the {TPS} and the volumes revealed that the {MRI/gel} readout had closer resemblance to the {TPS} than the optical {CT/PresageTM} readout.

  abstract={Microbeam radiation therapy {(MRT),} a novel form of spatially fractionated radiotherapy {(RT),} uses arrays of synchrotron-generated X-ray microbeams {(MB).} {MRT} has been identified as a promising treatment concept that might be applied to patients with malignant central nervous system {(CNS)} tumours for whom, at the current stage of development, no satisfactory therapy is available yet. Preclinical experimental studies have shown that the {CNS} of healthy rodents and piglets can tolerate much higher radiation doses delivered by spatially separated {MBs} than those delivered by a single, uninterrupted, macroscopically wide beam. High-dose, high-precision radiotherapies such as {MRT} with reduced probabilities of normal tissue complications offer prospects of improved therapeutic ratios, as extensively demonstrated by results of experiments published by many international groups in the last two decades. The significance of developing {MRT} as a new {RT} approach cannot be understated. Up to 50\% of cancer patients receive conventional {RT,} and any new treatment that provides better tumour control whilst preserving healthy tissue is likely to significantly improve patient outcomes.},

  journal={Physica Medica},
  year={2015},
  abstract={Microbeam radiation therapy {(MRT)} is an irradiation modality for therapeutic purposes which uses arrays of collimated quasi parallel microbeams, each up to 100 μm wide, to deliver high radiation doses. Several studies have reported the extraordinary tolerance of normal tissues to {MRT} irradiation; conversely, {MRT} has been shown to be highly efficient on tumor growth control. The original and most widely developed application of {MRT,} yet in the preclinical phase, consists in using spatially fractionated X-ray beams issued from a synchrotron radiation source in the treatment of brain tumors. More recently, {MRT} has been tested in successful pioneering assays to reduce or interrupt seizures in preclinical models of epilepsy. The {MRT} concept has also been extended to proton therapy. The development of {MRT} towards its clinical implementation is presently driven by an {EU-supported} consortium of laboratories from 16 countries within the {COST} Action {TD1205} {(SYRA3).} The results of the first {SYRA3} workshop on {“Radiation} Therapy with Synchrotron Radiation: Achievements and Challenges” held in Krakow {(Poland)} during March 25–26 2014 are summarized in this issue with an overview presented in this paper. The papers reflect the multidisciplinary international activities of {SYRA3.} The topics covered in this focus issue include medical physics aspects, pre-clinical studies, clinical applications, and an industrial perspective; finally an outlook towards future prospects of compact sources and proton microbeams.},

Robust organizing centers were recently discovered numerically in several cases, motivating a search for them in nature. But if a candidate were observed there would still be no way to examine it for the expected topological intricacies. To solve this problem we designed and constructed a hybrid chemical/optical/computational instrument using the familiar principles of tomography by filtered backprojection. We demonstrate here that it can quantitatively resolve chemical vortex filaments in a new excitable medium fashioned for the purpose. The next step, not described here, is to use the light sensitivity of this medium to contrive initial conditions from which topologically exotic organizing centers would arise and possibly persist.

  abstract={Two proposed likelihood models for emission and transmission image reconstruction accurately incorporate the Poisson nature of photon counting noise and a number of other relevant physical features. As in most algebraic schemes, the region to be reconstructed is divided into small pixels. For each pixel a concentration or attenuation coefficient must be estimated. In the maximum likelihood approach these parameters are estimated by maximizing the likelihood (probability of the observations). {EM} algorithms are iterative techniques for finding maximum likelihood estimates. In this paper we discuss the general principles behind all {EM} algorithms and derive in detail the specific algorithms for emission and transmission tomography. The virtues of the {EM} algorithms include (a) accurate incorporation of a good physical model, (b) automatic inclusion of non-negativity constraints on all parameters, (c) an excellent measure of the quality of a reconstruction, and (d) global convergence to a single vector of parameter estimates. We discuss the specification of necessary physical features such as source and detector geometries. Actual reconstructions are deferred to a later time.}

This is particularly useful for imaging tumor angiogenesis. Cancer-cell trafficking through the cardiovascular and lymphatic systems is the critical means of spread of cancer. The use of fluorescent proteins to differentially label cancer calls in the nucleus and cytoplasm and high-powered imaging technology are used to visualize the nuclear-cytoplasmic dynamics of cancer-cell trafficking in both blood vessels and lymphatic vessels in the live animal. This technology has furthered our understanding of the spread of cancer at the subcellular level in the live mouse.
