Orthogonal cross-section slices of a reconstructed ZD6126-treated spleen image volume from Dataset 2 with FOV (5.3 mm)$^3$. The yellow boxes indicate the position of the region-of-interest (ROI) (size $200 \times 200 \times 30$ pixels) chosen for textural feature analysis. ROIs for the other samples were chosen to be in similar positions with respect to spleen boundaries. c. Representation of the four angular pixel directions used in grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) calculations. For each pixel displacement, $d$, GLCMs were calculated in each angular direction and averaged to give one GLCM per displacement distance. d. Demonstration of the relative positions of three reference pixels used in 3-D GLCM calculations for the case of $d = 2$ and $\theta =45^{\circ }$. For 2-D GLCM calculations only pixels $i$ and $j$ were compared. 3-D GLCM analysis incorporates depth information by including a third reference pixel, $k$, in the $z$ direction. Pixel positions changes $\Delta x, \Delta y$ and $\Delta z$ can be calculated from Equation\nobreakspace  {}\relax 4.1\hbox {}.\relax }}{70}}
