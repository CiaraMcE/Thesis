Called Telecentric set-up. Many advantages. page8

Read chap 5 Hecht for focussing optics. Focussing on the sample and CCD more complex - different n and refractions. Experiment with different position using approx equation to predict object distance. pg9

pg11 - exp to find size of acceptance angle.
